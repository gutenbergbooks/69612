<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“W</span>hat’s</span> happened to Mr. Grant, I
wonder?” remarked Sea Scout Peter
Craddock, as he gazed anxiously through the
gathering twilight. “He’s late.”</p>

<p>“So will we be, if we keep hanging-on to the
slack,” rejoined Patrol Leader Frank Brandon.
“There are only eighteen more days to the Sea
Scouts’ Jamboree, and if we’re to be in it, there’s
not a minute to waste. Mr. Grant’s all right,
never you fear.”</p>

<p>Craddock straightened his aching back, wiped
the perspiration from his eyes, and resumed his
voluntary though tedious task. He, too, realised
that time was precious if the “Otters” were to
be represented at the forthcoming and eagerly
anticipated nautical festivities of the Sea Scouts’
Jamboree.</p>

<p>The “Otters” were a long way from their
native Aberstour. Force of circumstances had hit
them pretty hard of late, but, like corks, they
bobbed up again under adversity as all scouts
should do.</p>

<p>For one thing, their staunch little yacht <span class='it'>Puffin</span>
was no more. She had foundered at her moorings
in a terrific autumn gale that had sprung up with
such suddenness that the official weather forecast
had failed to give any warning whatsoever. Then,
Mr. Grant, their Scoutmaster, had a serious
illness that put him out of the running for three
months. Patrol Leader Frank Brandon was away
on a five months’ involuntary voyage on a tramp
steamer, and had only just returned.</p>

<p>In the absence of Scoutmaster and Patrol
Leader, Peter Craddock did his level best to keep
the troop running, and by dint of sheer enthusiasm
he had succeeded.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant had recovered his health when the
Sea Scouts’ Jamboree was announced. It was
to be a gathering of every troop in the United
Kingdom, and was to be held in the spacious
land-locked waters of Chichester harbour. There
were to be sailing and motor-boat races, rowing
and sculling matches, swimming and diving contests,
and numerous competitions in which the
Sea Scouts were to display their prowess. For
those lads who were unable to come round in
their own craft a splendid camping site was
provided; but, as Peter Craddock remarked, a
lot of the fun would be missed if the “Otters”
had to hike it by road, and then be compelled
to see others display their seamanship, they
themselves being unable to compete in friendly
rivalry. Without the <span class='it'>Puffin</span>, the outlook seemed
a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Then, quite unexpectedly, a chance presented
itself. The Scoutmaster heard of a suitable craft
offered for sale at a very reasonable figure owing
to the present owner finding himself unable to
carry out his original intentions.</p>

<p>She was an ex-naval “launch”—a boat propelled
either by sail or oars—of very substantial
construction and only a few years old. She was
forty-two feet in length and diagonal built. That is
to say, she had her planks doubled, those forming
the outer skin running diagonally on those of the
inner skin. This system resulted in great strength
of hull, while in addition the edges of the planking
were “flush,” otherwise a smooth surface.</p>

<p>Her present owner had intended to convert the
launch into a ketch yacht, and had already given
her a fairly deep iron keel and had commenced to
deck her in and build a cabin. Then he “stuck”
owing to lack of funds; and to make the best of
his bargain offered the craft as she stood.</p>

<p>“As she stood,” meant that she was lying afloat
at Polkebo Creek, a remote inlet of the spacious
Cornish harbour of Falmouth, which was a long
way from Aberstour.</p>

<p>The Sea Scouts held a council of ways and
means. Fortunately they had seven weeks’ holiday.
The proposal of a trip to Falmouth to bring back
the boat seemed alluring. As for the completion
of the conversion job, the lads were all handy with
carpenters’ tools: their Troop funds were enough
to justify the expenses.</p>

<p>The deal was completed, and the “Otters”
lost no time in proceeding to Falmouth and taking
over the new craft.</p>

<p>Compared with the <span class='it'>Puffin</span> she was a lump of a
boat. With her newly fitted iron keel she was “as
stiff as a house.” Her original masts, sails, anchor,
chain and other gear were stored in a shed adjoining
the creek. Timber and other necessary
material were readily procurable at Falmouth.
Most of these were brought by water in a serviceable
14-foot dinghy that had been included in the
bargain.</p>

<p>Work progressed apace. The Sea Scouts stuck
it gamely, cheerfully working long hours in the
assurance that theirs was a labour of love for that
fickle taskmistress the sea. The kindly fisherfolk
of Polkebo took great interest in “them young
furriners,” giving the amateur shipwrights many
useful hints and, what was more, helpful assistance.</p>

<p>There was one exception, however. That was
Carlo Bone, generally known as Blueskin, a hulking
lout of about thirty and the despair of the
district. He was tall, heavily built and, with
proper exercise and clean living, ought to have
been a formidable figure in the old Cornish
pastime of wrestling. Unfortunately he showed
no inclination either to work or to play decently.
When sheer necessity compelled him to work, he
sometimes shipped on board a coaster. The local
fisherfolk knew him only too well, and there was
never a berth for him in the pilchard fleet. During
his many spells of idleness “on the beach,” he
spent all the time the Law allows in lounging in
public-houses. He was a cunning poacher, but
he had never been caught in the act. Rumour had
it that he combined the undesirable occupations
of thief and smuggler. Already his evil life had
left its mark. His face was flabby, and his features
were of a purplish hue. Hence his name Blueskin.</p>

<p>Blueskin had a grievance against the Sea Scouts.
He had hoped to obtain possession of the ex-Service
launch by fair means or, preferably, by
foul; but the late owner had refused to part with
the boat merely on vague promises to pay, coming
as they did from Carlo Bone. From morning to
night, except when the “Dog and Gun” was open,
Blueskin would lounge about on the quayside
and bombard the lads with sarcastic and offensive
remarks, attempting in vain to make them abandon
their task.</p>

<p>On the afternoon on which this story opens,
Mr. Grant and Sea Scout Carline had rowed to
the Prince of Wales’s pier at Falmouth to bring
off provisions and sundry stores. It was now
nearly ten o’clock, and they had not returned. The
long Cornish twilight was setting in. In another
twenty minutes, night would have fallen. For a
wonder, Blueskin’s now familiar and unwelcome
figure had not put in an appearance that evening.</p>

<p>“Knock off now, lads!” ordered Brandon.
“It’s been a long day, but we simply had to finish
that bulkhead. Start the stove, Wilson, my lad.
I don’t suppose Mr. Grant will be much longer.
He’s got a fair tide up.”</p>

<p>Wilson went below, leaving the Patrol Leader,
Craddock, Talbot, and Heavitree to put away the
tools and to spread a tarpaulin over the as yet
unpainted cabin-top.</p>

<p>At that moment the Sea Scouts noticed Carlo
Bone slouching towards the quay. At every few
steps he stopped and tugged savagely at a length
of rope, the while cursing loudly. At the other
end of the rope was a dog, or rather a puppy of
about two months.</p>

<p>With the instinctiveness of its kind, the little
animal realised that something more unpleasant
than its usual treatment at the hands of its brutal
owner was in store for it. Vainly it tried to break
away, only to be jerked remorselessly onwards.</p>

<p>“The cad!” muttered Craddock. “He’s doing
that just to make us lose our tempers. He knows
Mr. Grant isn’t here, and there isn’t a policeman
to be seen anywhere about.”</p>

<p>Peter Craddock was perfectly right in his surmise.
Blueskin was doing his best to pick a
quarrel at the expense of the little animal’s life.
Deliberately, as far as his unsteady gait permitted,
he dragged the puppy to the edge of the quay,
where in full view of the Sea Scouts he bent the
free end of the rope round a heavy stone.</p>

<p>For a wonder he said nothing; but the ugly
leer on his flabby face was enough. He was going
to drown the dog before the eyes of the practically
helpless Sea Scouts. Nothing short of a display
of concerted brute force could stop him. He knew
that. There is no law in the country to prevent a
man drowning his own dog, provided he does it
with reasonable celerity.</p>

<p>The Sea Scouts scrambled on to the quay.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” demanded
Brandon.</p>

<p>“Gwine ter du? Seems you’ve no eyes, like,”
retorted Blueskin thickly. “You’m not th’ ones
tu stop I.”</p>

<p>“Will you sell us the dog?” asked the Patrol
Leader.</p>

<p>“Noa, I won’t,” was the ungracious reply.
“Thet pup ain’t no gude tu noabody. Teared
my boots tu pieces, ’e did; so in t’water ’e goes.
Get out o’ my way, I tell ye.”</p>

<p>The other Sea Scouts looked helplessly at the
Patrol Leader. Brandon gave no sign. In the
circumstances things looked hopeless. Blueskin
had the whip-hand; or at least he thought he
had.</p>

<p>He lifted both the puppy and the stone from the
ground.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Grinned tauntingly at the lads.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Prepared to hurl the terrified animal to its doom.</p>

<p>Stepping behind his chums, Peter Craddock
felt for his keen-edged knife. He had the ready
knack of opening it with one hand. He did so,
and as unostentatiously released it from the
swivel.</p>

<p>“Let the brute throw the dog in,” he whispered
in Brandon’s ear. “Don’t attempt to stop
him.”</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader turned in amazement. One
look at his chum’s determined features told him
that Peter Craddock had something up his sleeve.
Peter had: in a double sense. The keen blade, edge
outwards, was nestling against his wrist.</p>

<p>There was a splash. The puppy, weighted by
the heavy stone, struck the water six feet below
the quay. A second later and Peter Craddock
took a magnificent header close to the spot where
the little animal had disappeared.</p>

<p>Craddock was a splendid diver. Three years in
succession he had won a prize in the plate-diving
competition at the Aberstour Regatta, and now he
was putting his skill to a practical test.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/024.jpg' alt='' id='img24' style='width:90%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>It was a difficult matter to see under the water
in the failing daylight, but before the stone touched
bottom, Peter’s left hand caught the fiercely struggling
puppy. One quick movement of the keen
knife and the deed was done. Still retaining his
hold of the released animal, Craddock shot to the
surface, and amidst the ringing cheers of his now
thoroughly excited chums struck out for the stone
steps at the end of the quay.</p>

<p>But Blueskin had yet to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>“That’s my pup,” he declared angrily, planting
himself in front of the dripping Sea Scout.
“ ’And ’im ower tu me. In ’e goes intu the ditch
agen, I tells yu.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” protested Peter coolly. “It was
yours. When you threw the dog in you threw
away all rights to it. It’s ours now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Take
charge of it, please, Brandon.”</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader took the shivering pup. The
animal, fearing further punishment, struggled
frantically to gain the shelter of its rescuer’s protecting
arms.</p>

<p>Carlo Bone was flabbergasted. His slowly acting
brain was trying to think out the problem.
No doubt that interfering “furriner” was right.
He was a fool not to stop him from diving to the
rescue. There yet remained the question of brute
force. He would be more than a match for the
whole crowd of “they Sea Scoutses.”</p>

<p>“Gimme that dawg!” he shouted, striding
towards the Patrol Leader.</p>

<p>Peter barred his way. Blueskin aimed a vicious
blow at Craddock’s chest. The Sea Scout, in
successfully evading the massive fist, stepped
backwards. As he did so his rubber-soled shoes
slithered on the stones, for no footgear is proof
against the slippery quays of the West Country
where fish have just been landed. He fell. The
bully promptly dealt him a kick with his heavy
sea-boot.</p>

<p>There is a limit to human endurance, even to
that of a well-disciplined patrol of Scouts. In an
instant Fred Heavitree planted himself between
Blueskin and the prostrate Craddock.</p>

<p>Heavitree was the latest recruit to the “Otters.”
He was a tall, slim youth of a somewhat retiring
disposition, keen at his work and yet never before
displaying any signs of unusual strength and
activity. His chums were about to get one of
life’s surprises; so was Blueskin.</p>

<p>“Keep back, you fellows,” cautioned Heavitree
in a low yet compelling tone.</p>

<p>The bully, thinking he had an easy task, let out
a terrific left. Had it reached its objective, Heavitree
would have been lifted clean off his feet. The
Sea Scout was unable to spring back out of harm’s
way, because Craddock was still on the ground.
Instead, without moving his feet, he inclined his
body from the waist.</p>

<p>Blueskin’s fist met nothing more resisting than
air. Before he could recover his balance, the Sea
Scout had him properly. A tremendous thud as
Heavitree’s left caught the bully fairly between
the eyes was almost simultaneously followed by a
heavy right straight to the <span class='it'>solar plexus</span>.</p>

<p>Heavitree stood his ground, guarding to meet a
counter-attack. It was a judicious but unnecessary
precaution, for Carlo Bone, his arms whirling
like windmills, staggered backwards for three or
four yards, and collapsed in a heap upon the
rough pavement.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER II &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Mascot</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>or</span> some moments the Sea Scouts remained
dumbfounded at their chum’s prowess.
Heavitree, by far the least perturbed, stood
silently regarding the prostrate form of his late
antagonist.</p>

<p>“You’ve killed him, Fred,” exclaimed Wilson.</p>

<p>“Not I,” replied Heavitree. “He’ll be all
right in ten minutes or so, ’cept perhaps for a bad
headache. Did he give you much of a hack,
Peter?”</p>

<p>“He tried to,” said Craddock, as he examined
his shin. The skin had been slightly lacerated
and was bleeding a little. The moisture draining
from the Sea Scout’s saturated shorts and mingling
with the crimson fluid made the abrasion look
far worse than it actually was. “He tried to; but
his feet sort of side-slipped. My word, Fred!
That was a knock-out blow. Where did you learn
that?”</p>

<p>Before the specialist in the art of “knocking
out” could reply, a number of fisherfolk and
villagers came hurrying to the quay. One of the
number had seen Blueskin floored, and had communicated
the news to the frequenters of the
“Dog and Gun,” with the result that “closing
time” was anticipated for the first time in the
annals of that ancient inn to the extent of nearly
three minutes.</p>

<p>“Sakes, if ’tisn’t Blueskin!” exclaimed a
bearded fisherman. “Laid out prapper-like, tu.
’Ave ye been hittin’ he ower head with a
hammer?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Brandon. “He went for one of
us: kicked him. So Heavitree knocked him
down.”</p>

<p>“What with?” asked the astonished Cornishman.</p>

<p>“His fist. It was a fair blow,” declared the
Patrol Leader.</p>

<p>“Did he now? Us ’ud think ’twould take
more’n a fist tu settle the loikes of ’e. We’m
right glad, we’m is; but harkee—Blueskin’s a
twi’ble dangerous man to fall foul wi’. He’ll get
his own back, loike, e’en if he’s tu wait ten year.
Isn’t that so, friends?”</p>

<p>The other villagers nodded their heads.</p>

<p>“We’ll look out, then,” rejoined Brandon.
“Well, there’s nothing more to be done, I take it.
Come on, Peter, and change your gear.”</p>

<p>With the rescued puppy nestling in the Patrol
Leader’s arms the Sea Scouts returned on board,
leaving the Polkebo folk to carry the still unconscious
form of their unpopular fellow-villager to
the ramshackle and sordid cottage which he called
his home.</p>

<p>The Sea Scouts crowded into their partly
finished cabin. The lamp had been lighted; a
large iron kettle was on the stove. Compared
with the comfortable cabin of the little <span class='it'>Puffin</span>, the
place looked barn-like and cheerless. It had yet
to be made into a really habitable cabin, but even
now it was rain-proof and afforded the lads a
shelter even if it were a case of “sleeping
rough.”</p>

<p>“Rummy looking little beast, what?” commented
Brandon, pausing in the act of drying the
puppy’s coat to study the general appearance of
the rescued animal. Even for a puppy its hair was
long, its ears drooping. Neck, chest and forefeet
were white, as was a blaze extending almost to the
tip of its jet-black nose. The rest of the fur was
of a dark grey hue.</p>

<p>“It’s our mascot, anyway,” declared Wilson.
“My word, Peter; you were pretty smart in
diving after it.”</p>

<p>“Was I?” rejoined Craddock in a muffled
tone as he struggled into a dry jersey. “I hadn’t
any idea how long I was under. It was just luck
grabbing the pup as I did.”</p>

<p>“What shall we call it?” enquired Symington.</p>

<p>“That’s for Peter to say,” replied Brandon.
“He saved the pup.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hello! Here’s the dinghy
alongside.”</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m late, lads!” exclaimed Mr. Grant,
as he stepped into the cabin, blinking as he did so
at the strong light compared to the darkness without.
“We’ve had rather an interesting yarn with
Scoutmaster Pendennis, haven’t we, Carline? His
Sea Scouts are going to the Jamboree, too; so
we’ll—Hello! What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Our mascot, sir,” replied Brandon, holding
out the pup for inspection.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it from?” asked Mr.
Grant.</p>

<p>“It was that chap Carlo Bone’s, sir,” was the
somewhat vague reply.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster showed no great enthusiasm
over the announcement. He did not like the idea
of the lads accepting any favours from a surly
good-for-nothing rascal of that type.</p>

<p>“Did he give it you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the Patrol Leader. “He
threw the pup into the creek, and Peter fetched
it out. Then——”</p>

<p>“Suppose you tell the yarn from the beginning,
Brandon,” said Mr. Grant quietly. “This sounds
rather interesting.”</p>

<p>Frank Brandon did so. The Scoutmaster
listened without making any comment until the
story was completed.</p>

<p>“It served Blueskin right,” he remarked. “I’m
sorry we’ve had a row, but he evidently asked for
it. We’ll have to be careful when he’s about.
I didn’t know, you were a budding pugilist,
Heavitree. Where did you learn to use your
fists?”</p>

<p>“At school, sir. We were taught boxing. I
was supposed to be rather good at it; only one
day I hit a fellow rather hard. It was a sparring
match. I really didn’t mean to hurt him, but I
did. After that I felt afraid of myself and dropped
boxing.”</p>

<p>“We’ve won our mascot, haven’t we, sir?”
enquired Brandon.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant assented.</p>

<p>“We were going to give it a name when you
came back, sir,” said Peter.</p>

<p>“Carry on, then,” prompted the Scoutmaster.
“What do you suggest?”</p>

<p>“Bruin, sir; it’s like a teddy bear.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” exclaimed Mr. Grant dubiously.
“It’s hardly the correct thing to call a female
dog by a masculine name. You’d better start on
another tack. Well, that’s a matter for you fellows
to discuss. How have you been getting on?”</p>

<p>“We’ve finished the bulkhead to your cabin,”
announced Peter. “The cabin-top has had the
first coat of paint ready for the canvas to be
stretched. Wilson and Talbot have been fitting
the bunks in the main cabin, so we won’t have to
sleep on the floor in future.”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” said Mr. Grant encouragingly.
“To-morrow if it’s fine we’ll polish off that cabin-top.
We ought to have the masts stepped, and
the standing rigging set up by the end of the week.
That reminds me: Scoutmaster Pendennis is
taking a patrol to the Jamboree in the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>.
We’ll be cruising in company unless the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> is
too smart for us. I hope our craft will prove to
be fairly fast—enough to keep up with her.
Talking about names: we haven’t given our boat
a name yet.”</p>

<p>“How would <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> do, sir?” suggested
Brandon. “A merlin is a sort of hawk, and so is
a kestrel.”</p>

<p>“Good idea!” agreed Mr. Grant. “Now,
you fellows: supper and bed. We’ve another
long day’s work in front of us to-morrow. I don’t
fancy Mr. Carlo Bone will favour us with his undesirable
attendance to-night.”</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances the Sea Scouts slept
like logs. Already they were quite hardened to
lying on bare boards. To-night for the first time
since their arrival at Polkebo Creek, they were
sleeping either on bunks extending the whole
length and both sides of the main saloon or in
hammocks slung from the beams. Yet, in spite
of the great improvement in comfort, they showed
no inclination for repose. They chattered, discussing
a suitable name for their mascot and going
over the events of that memorable evening until
Mr. Grant’s voice, coming from the adjoining
cabin, bade them keep quiet.</p>

<p>After that the silence was broken only by the
whimpering of the puppy. She, too, was doubtless
going through the terrifying time when she
was struggling under water weighted down by a
stone.</p>

<p>It was not until Peter Craddock put his arm
over the side of his bunk and stroked the now
soft, silky hair that the little animal quieted down.
Licking the hand of her rescuer, she gave a little
sigh of gratification and confidence and dropped
into a sound slumber.</p>

<p>Bodily tired though he was, Peter simply could
not sleep. He lay thinking and thinking—which
is a jolly bad symptom in a healthy youth. He
was puzzling his brains to decide upon a suitable
name for the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> mascot.</p>

<p>Presently he realised that fine rain was falling
on the tarpaulin placed over the uncompleted
cabin-top. It was a strange sort of rain—falling
intermittently. It smelt strange, too.</p>

<p>“Petrol!” thought the lad.</p>

<p>He sniffed suspiciously. This surmise was confirmed.
The interior of the cabin was reeking
with the fumes of that highly inflammable
spirit.</p>

<p>In a flash the Sea Scout’s mind was alert.</p>

<p>There could be but one solution to the mystery.
Blueskin, utterly reckless in his mad desire to
revenge himself, was spraying petrol on the yacht’s
deck. At any moment a lighted match thrown by
the miscreant on the quayside would make the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> a mass of flaming woodwork.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER III &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>An All-Night Watch</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>eter Craddock</span> had to decide promptly
upon his plan of action. Two courses suggested
themselves: either to arouse Mr. Grant
and give the alarm, or else to scare the miscreant
away.</p>

<p>He decided upon the latter plan. Too much
valuable time would be wasted in waking the
Scoutmaster. More than likely the other Sea
Scouts would be roused; and then, if one of them
struck a match, the highly explosive mixture of
air and petrol in the cabin would go up with
terrific force. No; his best plan would be to
frighten away the cowardly rogue, who was certainly
counting upon the supposition that the
crew of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were sleeping soundly, in order
to carry out his diabolical plan.</p>

<p>Grasping an electric torch that he always kept
within hand’s reach during the night watches,
Peter slipped out of his bunk, glided noiselessly
out of the cabin, and gained the cockpit. Then,
directing the torch towards the quay, he released
a dazzling ray.</p>

<p>He was too late to spot the miscreant. In spite
of the Sea Scout’s cautious movements, the man
had heard the disturbing sounds. Afraid to complete
his dastardly work, the fellow had taken to
his heels. Peter could hear his boots clattering
upon the stone paving.</p>

<p>It was now almost dead low water. The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
was high and dry, supported by legs and lying
parallel to and at a distance of a couple of yards
from the quay, the edge of which rose quite eight
feet above the deck. Consequently the quay served
as a ridge to prevent the rays of Peter’s torch
sweeping the whole extent of the open expanse
between the line of cottages and the creek.</p>

<p>By the time Craddock had gained the cabin-top,
whence he could command a view of the
adjoining ground, the fellow had disappeared.
Although this escape of the miscreant was a disappointment,
Peter realised that his hideous plans
had been frustrated.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” enquired Mr. Grant’s voice
from the cabin. Aroused by Craddock’s movements—and
it is remarkable how plainly the
faintest sound can be heard on deck when only
three-quarters of an inch of matchboarding intervenes—the
Scoutmaster sat up, listening intently.
Evidently the fumes of the petrol had not as yet
penetrated the bulkhead separating his cabin from
the one in which the seven Sea Scouts slept.</p>

<p>Before replying Peter re-entered the saloon.
As he did so the puppy gave an aggressive
growl. Brandon woke up.</p>

<p>“Phew!” he ejaculated. “What a whiff!”</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Peter. “Turn out, old son,
and rouse the others. Don’t let any of them strike
a light. The place is chock full of petrol fumes.”</p>

<p>“What’s that—petrol fumes?” demanded Mr.
Grant from the partitioned-off cabin.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Craddock. “Can you come
on deck? I’ve a torch handy.”</p>

<p>By this time the other Sea Scouts with one
exception were “beginning to sit up and take
notice.” During the process, Talbot, who was
sleeping in a hammock, bumped his head against
a deck beam. His swaying resting-place swayed
still more, slinging him out and depositing him on
one of the bunks where Wilson was sleeping
soundly. Mutual protests arose only to be
checked by the Patrol Leader, who bade the pair,
“Stow that row and get your things on.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Grant had hurriedly dressed.
Making sure that every lad realised the supreme
importance of refraining from striking a match,
he told Brandon, Craddock, Heavitree, and Carline
to follow him while the others dispersed the
dangerous fumes from the interior of the saloon.</p>

<p>“Which way did the fellow go, Peter?” asked
Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>Craddock told him.</p>

<p>“Away from his cottage, then,” continued the
Scoutmaster. “Good! We’ll picket the place.
A scoundrel like that deserves all he gets; but
it’s just possible that he didn’t realise what might
have happened. His idea might have been to set
the yacht on fire and give us a scare. He may not
know the properties of air and petrol as an explosive
mixture. Although he only squirted the
petrol on the tarpaulin on the cabin-top, the fumes,
being heavier than the atmosphere, settled inside
the boat.”</p>

<p>Accompanied by the four Sea Scouts, Mr. Grant
made his way to Carlo Bone’s cottage, a ramshackle
stone structure of two storeys situated
about a hundred yards from the furthermost row
of houses that formed the hamlet of Polkebo. At
the back was a neglected garden of about a quarter
of an acre in extent and enclosed by a low wall of
ashlar masonry. There were two doors to the
cottage, one opening directly upon the street, and
gained by a flight of eight stone steps; the other
led into the garden and was also reached by steps.
The windows were small, heavily barred, and so
high from the ground that it was impossible for
anyone to see in without the aid of a ladder.</p>

<p>“It wants an hour and a half to sunrise,” remarked
Mr. Grant, after he had consulted the
luminous dial of his wristlet watch. “Possibly
Mr. Bone will return before then. I doubt
whether he has had time to do so already. In any
case, we’ll investigate.”</p>

<p>Posting Brandon and Heavitree at the front of
the cottage, Mr. Grant followed by Craddock and
Carline, scaled the low wall and crept up to the
back door. The Scoutmaster flashed his torch
upon the latch. A spider had built a web across
the door. The air was warm and saturated with
dew, and glistening particles of moisture hung
from the undisturbed web. In fact, webs
abounded. Almost every tree and shrub was
festooned with them.</p>

<p>Obviously Blueskin had not re-entered his
cottage by that door. Satisfied on that ground,
Mr. Grant withdrew with his companions. The
garden was, after all, private property. Legally
the would-be victims were trespassing. In addition,
they were laying themselves open to an act
of violence should Carlo Bone return and find
them there. The poacher, according to report,
would not hesitate to use a gun or a knife should
he find himself cornered.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant, however, had no wish to corner the
fellow. For the present he wanted to be in a
position to prove that Blueskin was the perpetrator
of the outrage and a step in that direction
was to be able to make certain that the man was
away from his cottage. If so, on his return he
would be almost sure to bring with him the reek of
petrol, even if he had got rid of the implements
by which he had sprayed the fluid.</p>

<p>“Now, you fellows,” he said in a low voice,
addressing Craddock and Carline, “I want you
to keep a sharp look-out on the back of the cottage.
Take cover, and keep your eyes and ears on the
alert.”</p>

<p>“And if he shows up, sir, do we tackle him?”
asked Peter.</p>

<p>“Rather not; that’s a job for the police. I’ll
look you up occasionally. I’ll see what Brandon
and Heavitree are doing.”</p>

<p>Before rejoining the Sea Scouts posted in concealment
in the front of the building, Mr. Grant
examined the front door. Here, as in the case of
the back entrance, the presence of an undisturbed
spider’s web gave conclusive proof that Blueskin
had not entered the cottage by that means. Since
he could not do so through the barred windows,
the inference was that he was still away.</p>

<p>For the rest of the hours of darkness, the Scoutmaster
divided his time between the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> and
the two observation posts. Everything seemed
quiet. No sound came from either within or without
the darkened cottage. If Carlo Bone were to
return, it seemed probable that he would do so
before dawn in order to avoid recognition from
any of the early risers of the hamlet.</p>

<p>At length grey dawn paled in the north-eastern
sky. The birds began singing, cocks crowed.
The mist over the creek drifted slowly in the faint
air-currents. In one of the cottages smoke began
to issue from the squat stone chimney.</p>

<p>At sunrise the Scoutmaster withdrew his observers,
replacing Craddock and Heavitree by
Symington and Talbot. Wilson took Carline’s
place, but Craddock asked to be allowed to
remain.</p>

<p>From the cottages men went forth unto their
work and to their labour. On the rising tide the
fishing boats put out. By five o’clock the whole
place was astir.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant was frankly disappointed. The only
result of the Sea Scouts’ vigil was, in his opinion,
that they had proved that Carlo Bone had not
returned to his cottage.</p>

<p>“It’s no use waiting any longer, lads,” he said.
“We’ll get breakfast—you must all be ravenous—and
then I’ll see the police.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the front door of the cottage
opened and Blueskin appeared. He was fully
dressed, even to his cap and leather thigh-boots,
while across one shoulder he carried a painted
canvas sack. Both eyes were badly discoloured,
and the scowling look he gave to the Sea Scouts
added still further to the repulsiveness of his
features. Once he paused as if he were about to
utter a jibe, but thinking better of it, he trudged
stolidly up the lane leading to the high road
between Truro and Falmouth.</p>

<p>“We’ve been on the wrong tack this time, lads,”
declared the Scoutmaster. “He’s been in his
cottage all the time. Of course, he may have a
confederate in this business: that we’ll have to
find out or get the police to see to. Meanwhile,
breakfast, and then all hands turn in. It’s spoilt
our working day, I’m afraid.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER IV &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Investigations</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he Scoutmaster</span> was perfectly correct in his
surmise. Progress as far as the work on the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was concerned was virtually at a standstill
for that day. There were limits to the Sea
Scouts’ powers of endurance. The loss of a
night’s rest following upon an exciting day was
not to be made up by a few hours’ sleep during
the forenoon.</p>

<p>There was little rest for Mr. Grant. After
breakfast his first visit was to the police station to
report the case of attempted arson. The inspector
listened with ill-concealed incredulity until somewhat
reluctantly the Scoutmaster mentioned the
name of Carlo Bone.</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness you were certain that was
the fellow!” exclaimed the inspector. “We’ve
been wanting to lay him by the heels for months
past, but we can never fix him. He’s as slippery
as an eel. You say he assaulted one of your lads
and got knocked down in the process. Knowing
the man, I’ve no doubt but what he will try to
score off you.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” agreed Mr. Grant. “We felt so
sure that he was the fellow that we kept watch on
his cottage all night. He didn’t go into the place.
There were indisputable signs to show that neither
of the doors had been open for some hours. At
daybreak, or just after, he emerged from the
cottage and went off.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” ejaculated the inspector. “On the
face of it, Carlo Bone could easily establish an
alibi. I know the cottage. The windows are as
heavily barred as a prison. Yet, knowing Bone as
I do, it wouldn’t surprise me to—— By the by,
have you missed any gear? No? Well, that’s
rather unfortunate in a way. Had you done so,
we would examine the cottage inside and out on
the strength of a search warrant.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he has had an accomplice?”
asked the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” he replied. “At least, not
at Polkebo and district. He’s not popular with
his neighbours, and they’d welcome the news that
he’s doing a stretch. You are quite sure that it
was petrol that was squirted over your yacht?
Did you test the stuff?”</p>

<p>“If you mean did we set light to it to see
if it would burn—no,” answered Mr. Grant.
“Apart from that the indications were unmistakable.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a constable down to keep an eye on
things,” decided the inspector. “I don’t think
you’ll have any trouble when he’s about.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant thanked the police official and set off
back to the boat. He was not at all easy in his
mind. The situation in a nutshell was this: Some
person or persons unknown had been guilty of a
dastardly attempt to injure the lads under his care.
Blueskin might be, and probably was, innocent of
any knowledge of the matter. The miscreant
might be a homicidal lunatic or a person harbouring
an imaginary grudge against the crew of the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster was within fifty yards of Carlo
Bone’s cottage when the toe of his boot kicked
against a metallic object hidden in the long grass
by the side of the path. He stopped and pulled
aside the shoots. There, with one end overhanging
a shallow dry ditch, was a garden syringe.
The brasswork was dull, but not tarnished. The
rim of the jet-nozzle was fairly bright, showing
that at no distant date someone had had to use
considerable force to remove it from the threaded
end of the barrel.</p>

<p>Cautiously Mr. Grant removed the plunger and
smelt the inside of the barrel. There were no
fumes of petrol, but—significant fact—the leather
washer, which usually is well saturated with oil,
was bone dry. Had the syringe been used for
squirting water the leather would have retained
its dampness.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant’s next step was to go to the “Dog
and Gun,” and ask for Silas Pescold, the landlord.
Silas was a respected man in the little village, and
one who would be likely to identify the syringe.</p>

<p>He did without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Sure, zur,” he exclaimed. “Yes, Dick Marner’s.
Many’s the time I’ve borried et of him.”</p>

<p>“Marner? That’s the man who walks lame,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, zur; ’e broke ’is thigh come twenty
year agone aboard the old <span class='it'>Sarah</span>. Sin’ then,
seeing as ’e’s no good in the boats, ’e’s been doin’
odd gardenin’ jobs for the quality hereabouts.
Like as not you’ll find him up-along. ’E lives in
t’end cottage past the quay.”</p>

<p>The end cottage past the quay! It was in this
direction that the miscreant had made off when
Peter Craddock interrupted his operations.</p>

<p>Marner was at home. It was one of his bad
days. The easterly wind generally affected his
damaged hip.</p>

<p>“Is this your property?” asked Mr. Grant,
holding up the syringe for inspection.</p>

<p>“Sure, ’tes, zur,” assented the old chap without
hesitation. “If you’m wishful tu borrer ut
you’m kindly welcome.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t come to borrow it, Mr. Marner,”
rejoined Mr. Grant. “I’m here to return it to
you. I found it up the lane. Silas Pescold told
me it was yours.”</p>

<p>The old man puckered up his eye in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Found ’ut up-along, did ’e, zur?” he exclaimed.
“That be tur’ble queer, seein’ as I
locked ut in the shed las’ night.”</p>

<p>“At about what time?”</p>

<p>“Afore it wur dark, zur.”</p>

<p>“Evidently someone has broken into the shed,”
remarked Mr. Grant. “Have you been there to-day?
Perhaps it would be as well if you did.
I’ll come with you, if I may?”</p>

<p>The old man led the way up a steeply sloping
garden. In a corner formed by the junction of
two hedges was a tumble-down structure composed
of boats’ planking, weatherboards, corrugated
iron, and tarred felt. The lock was in position,
but it was one of those cheap varieties which could
easily be picked by means of a piece of bent
wire.</p>

<p>Marner threw open the door. Within were a
number of gardening tools, a pile of old sacks, a
motor bicycle, and two tins of petrol.</p>

<p>“That’s where I kept un,” declared Marner.
“It be gone, as ye see, zur. Nothin’ else be
touched as far as I can see.”</p>

<p>“Evidently someone borrowed it and lost it,”
said the Scoutmaster. “That’s a nice motor bike:
you don’t ride it, do you, Mr. Marner?”</p>

<p>The old man chuckled wheezily.</p>

<p>“Not wi’ this leg, zur. Yes, tes my boy
Richard’s; same name as mine ’e be called. ’E
wur a Scout same as your lads.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope Master Richard isn’t mixed up
in this business,” thought the Scoutmaster; then,
aloud: “He’s not a Scout now, is he?”</p>

<p>Marner chuckled again.</p>

<p>“ ’E’s mate aboard th’ tawps’l schooner <span class='it'>Huterp</span>
o’ Fowey,” he announced proudly. “She’s gone
foreign wi’ a cargo o’ clay. Where eggsackly I
can’t remember like. Reckon she’s about due
back come a week or so; an’ if so happen you’m
still hereabouts ye might see ’im.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant gave a sigh of relief. It was with no
slight degree of satisfaction that he realised the
impossibility of Dick Marner, ex-Scout and the
apple of the father’s eye, being implicated in this
unpleasant business.</p>

<p>The while he was conversing with the old man,
Mr. Grant kept his eyes wide open. There was
nothing of the nature of a clue as far as the shed
was concerned. The floor was of hard trodden
clay. No tell-tale footprints had left their mark.
Both petrol cans, judging by the undisturbed dust
on them, had not been touched since Richard
Marner, junior, had shipped on board the topsail
schooner <span class='it'>Euterpe</span> of Fowey. But obviously the
fellow who had broken into the shed knew his
bearings. He was aware that there was a syringe;
he wanted it, so he went to work to take it without
disturbing anything else.</p>

<p>“Do you know of any of your neighbours who
would borrow the syringe without asking you if
they might?” enquired the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>“No, zur,” replied Marner. “But why’m you
so askifying? You’m questionin’ me same as if
I wur a pickpocket at Bodmin Fair.”</p>

<p>It was a perfectly reasonable request. In the
circumstances, Mr. Grant realised that it was only
fair to old Marner to explain the facts that led up
to his visit.</p>

<p>“An’ you’m come here thinkin’ as ’ow my son
Dick had a-set fire to your boat?” demanded old
Marner angrily.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant hastened to pour uninflammable oil
upon troubled waters. In this he ultimately
succeeded, and, taking leave of the old man, he
returned to the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>. So far his investigation
had drawn blank; but, he reflected, his task was
to prevent a repetition of the dastardly attempt.
The detection of the offender might well be left
in the hands of the police.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER V &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Adrift</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>or</span> the next six or seven days the work of
getting the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> ready for sea proceeded
apace. The final coat of paint had been applied
and was now dry. Sails had been bent; running
rigging overhauled and rove; extra ballast in the
form of iron pigs had been stowed under the floor.
Fresh water and provisions had been brought on
board, and although there remained a considerable
amount of “finishing off” work to be done,
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was in a fit and seaworthy condition to
attempt her voyage up Channel.</p>

<p>No other disquieting incident had occurred
during the period, while to add to the serenity of
the situation definite information had been received
that Blueskin Bone had shipped on board
a tramp steamer at Falmouth and was now on his
way to Rotterdam.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> mascot had been making
steady progress. After much deliberation the Sea
Scouts had decided to bestow the name of Molly
upon the little animal. She was no longer the
terrified, half-drowned puppy that Peter had
rescued from the dark waters of the creek. Her
coat, carefully combed and brushed, had acquired
a gloss; her ribs were no longer painfully in
evidence. Already she realised that a human hand
could be something else than a means of imparting
pain, although it was some time before she ceased
to cringe in fear of a possible unwarranted thrashing.</p>

<p>“I wish Molly would be a little bit livelier,”
remarked Peter. “I’ve never seen such a sedate
pup.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, old son,” rejoined Brandon.
“She’s all right. P’raps before long she’ll be too
lively, even for you. How about a collar for her?”</p>

<p>“Later on,” decided Craddock. “If she had
one now she’d grow out of it in a week or so.
I’ll make one when we’re under way. As it is,
we haven’t a minute to spare.”</p>

<p>That was a fact. Time was getting on, and
there was still much to be done if the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were
to sail in company with the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>.</p>

<p>At length the eve of the eventful day arrived.
To-morrow at the hour of ten in the morning the
voyage up Channel was timed to commence, that
hour being fixed to enable both yachts to take
advantage of the first of the east-going tide.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, glistening in her new coat of paint,
looked very different from the half-completed
craft the Sea Scouts had taken over only a short
while ago. She was now a ketch-rigged yacht
with a spacious cockpit and ample accommodation
under her cabin-top. Her original sails had been
altered to form a serviceable and yet moderate
spread of canvas. The only thing wanting was a
motor; but, as Craddock observed, “Drake
hadn’t a motor when he sailed round the world;
so we ought to manage to find our way up Channel
without one.”</p>

<p>“All the same I wish we had an engine,” said
Carline. “The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> is a whopping lump of a
craft to move in a dead calm.”</p>

<p>“We may get a motor some day,” added Mr.
Grant. “When we’ve been shipmates with one
the lack of an engine seems a serious matter. We
must cut our coat according to our cloth, you
know. Now, lads, the tide’s making well. We’re
nearly afloat, so get busy.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was to be taken from Polkebo Creek
that evening and sailed down to a berth off Greenbank
at Falmouth, where the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> was lying, in
order that both craft might start together.</p>

<p>Almost everyone in Polkebo turned out to see
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> start, for with one exception (and he,
it was to be hoped, was far away) the inhabitants
of the hamlet were on excellent terms with the
Aberstour Sea Scouts. There was also much
speculation on the part of the professional seafaring
folk as to how the amateur-altered ex-Service
launch, manned chiefly by lads in their
teens, would be handled.</p>

<p>Although there was a steady leading wind the
houses and trees blanketed most of it; so without
difficulty canvas was set, sheets overrun, and
all preparation made before the rising tide floated
the yacht off.</p>

<p>“She’ll do it now, lads,” exclaimed Mr. Grant.
“Head-sheet to wind’ard, then! Cast off for’ard!”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> held only by the stern-warp, swung
slowly on her heel. She was afloat all right.</p>

<p>“Let go aft!” ordered the Scoutmaster.
“Trim your fore and jib sheets.”</p>

<p>Almost imperceptibly the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, steady as a
rock, gathered way. The crowd ashore cheered.
The Sea Scouts responded lustily. The gap between
the yacht and the quay widened. The
water began to ripple under the yacht’s forefoot.
She heeled to the strengthening breeze.</p>

<p>“Take her, Brandon,” said Mr. Grant, relinquishing
the tiller. “She’ll do.”</p>

<p>Against the still flowing tide the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> made
steady progress. She was “as stiff as a house,”
and showed a decided tendency to carry weather-helm—a
qualification that all craft under sail must
possess if they are to be accounted seaworthy.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> hove-to
within fifty yards of the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>, on which Scoutmaster
Pendennis and his crew of hefty Cornish
Sea Scouts were awaiting their approach.</p>

<p>“Sorry there are no moorings for you!” hailed
Mr. Pendennis. “Let go your anchor. Tide’s
slackening. She’ll ride head to wind all right.”</p>

<p>The anchor was dropped, sails stowed, riding
light trimmed ready to be hoisted at sunset. For
the rest of the evening the crews “palled up,”
some of the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> going aboard the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>,
while a part of the latter’s complement came over
to the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>At sunset the Sea Scouts returned to their
respective craft, had supper, and turned in.
Giving a final look round and satisfying himself
that the riding-light was burning clearly, Mr.
Grant followed the example of his crew.</p>

<p>“No need to turn out before seven,” he
announced. “Get in a good night’s rest while
you’ve the chance. You never know when you’ll
get another when we’re under way.”</p>

<p>Peter Craddock was the first to awake. A pale
grey light was filtering through the skylight. The
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was rolling slightly, and the dinghy had
just commenced to bump alongside.</p>

<p>“Turn of the tide, I expect,” thought the lad
drowsily. “It can’t be much more than five
o’clock. Too soon to turn out.”</p>

<p>Casually he glanced at his watch; looked again
and then held it to his ear. It was ticking merrily.
The hands pointed to twenty minutes past seven.
By that time it ought to be broad daylight. It
wasn’t.</p>

<p>Somewhat mystified, Peter rolled out of his
bunk and went on deck. To his surprise a thick
fog enveloped everything. From the companion
ladder it was only just possible to discern the
lower part of the mizzen-mast looking grotesquely
distorted in the watery haze. An uncanny silence
prevailed. No sounds came from the near-by
town. Then the distant wail of a syren came
through the mist.</p>

<p>According to the state of the tide, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
should be riding to the last of the ebb. How came
it then that the dinghy, instead of straining at her
painter, was rubbing alongside the yacht’s quarter?</p>

<p>“Something wrong,” muttered Peter, and
making his way for’ard along the damp and
clammy waterway, he gained the bows. Then he
felt the cable. The chain came up easily, and no
wonder; for instead of there being ten fathoms
of it, terminating in a seventy-pound anchor, only
a dozen links or so were trailing uselessly through
the hawse-pipe.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was adrift in a thick sea fog, and
at the mercy of the swirling tide.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER VI &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>In the Fog</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“T</span>urn</span> out, you fellows!” shouted Craddock.
“All hands on deck! We’ve parted
our cable, and there’s a heavy fog on.”</p>

<p>The rest of the crew tumbled out of their bunks
and hammocks and hurried into their clothes.
They accepted Peter’s statement without any
hesitation, for it was one of the few hard-and-fast
rules on board that on no account was a false
alarm to be knowingly raised. Skylarking in its
proper place was encouraged and harmless practical
joking permitted; but each Sea Scout had
been impressed with the seriousness of the harm
that might occur by raising the nautical equivalent
to the shout of “ ’Ware Wolf!” when there was
not one.</p>

<p>In various stages of “undress uniform,” Scoutmaster
and Sea Scouts gained the deck. The lads
remained silent, waiting for Mr. Grant’s orders.
He was frankly puzzled. The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had been
anchored surrounded by yachts and boats in the
crowded anchorage of Greenbank. It seemed
incredible that she should have drifted any distance
without fouling some of the craft in the
tideway.</p>

<p>Craddock had reported that the cable had
parted. Mr. Grant hoped that such was not the
case. He had known of anchors being dropped
with one of the flukes caught in the bobstay and
with only the bight of the chain resting on the
bottom. He rather wished such was the case
now.</p>

<p>“Get the fog-horn, Wilson,” he ordered.
“Two blasts about every minute, please. And,
Craddock, you might heave the lead. The others
prepare to make sail.”</p>

<p>Groping his way for’ard, for the fog was so
thick that even the still burning riding-lamp ten
feet above the deck was invisible, Mr. Grant
grasped the cable and hauled in the slack. One
look was sufficient. The last of the remaining
links had been deliberately cut through with a
hack-saw. The rest of the chain, together with
the anchor, was lying on the bed of Falmouth
Harbour—miles away, probably.</p>

<p>It was no time for feelings of resentment and
anger. The Scoutmaster came aft.</p>

<p>“What water have we?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No bottom, sir,” reported Peter.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant gave an involuntary gasp of astonishment.
The lead-line, 25 fathoms, or 150 feet, in
length, was insufficient to touch the bed of the sea.</p>

<p>“Bend another line to it,” he continued.</p>

<p>“I’m doing it already, sir,” announced Craddock.</p>

<p>“Good! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, how much?”</p>

<p>“Another four fathoms, sir,” reported the
leadsman.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster was on the point of going
below, when Wilson stopped him.</p>

<p>“Why are we to give two blasts, sir?” he enquired.
“Oughtn’t we to sound a bell or something
like that? We’re supposed to be at anchor.”</p>

<p>Even in his worried state of mind, Mr. Grant
did not hesitate to reply.</p>

<p>“It puzzled me what signal to make at first,”
he answered. “Although we were anchored—that
is to say, I thought we were—the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had
obviously moved. In that case we are under way,
and although we haven’t yet made sail, what wind
there is is on our port beam. Consequently it is
assumed that we are on the port tack; therefore,
two blasts.”</p>

<p>“Where are we, sir?” asked Carline.</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to find out,” replied Mr.
Grant. “I’m going below to look at the chart.”</p>

<p>Within the saloon the light was so dim that the
lamp had to be lighted before it was possible to
read the minute figures on the chart. Very soon
the Scoutmaster’s worst fears were confirmed.
Nowhere within Falmouth Harbour is a depth of
twenty-nine fathoms to be obtained, even at the
top of high-water springs. Obviously, then, the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had drifted with the tide right out of the
harbour without colliding with any other craft and
fortunately clearing the dangerous Black Rock that
lies in the mouth of the harbour and approximately
midway between the projecting arms of Pendennis
and St. Anthony. According to the soundings, the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was somewhere on a line extending from
the dreaded Manacles to the Dodman, and might
be anywhere between those points, a distance of
approximately fifteen sea-miles.</p>

<p>It was not an envious position for the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
to be in. There was no wind, but a very heavy
fog. She might or might not be in the way of
vessels making for or leaving Falmouth Harbour.
If she drifted northwards she would sooner or
later pile herself up upon the iron-bound coast.
The same condition would apply if she drifted
west’ard. Provided a breeze sprung up, the best
course was to make for the open Channel, but
even then there was a risk of being run down in
the busy steamer track that passed a few miles to
the south’ard of the Lizard. To attempt to grope
their way back to Falmouth, starting from an
absolutely unknown position, was out of the
question.</p>

<p>Effectually concealing his anxiety, Mr. Grant
returned on deck. By this time the Sea Scouts,
under Patrol Leader Brandon’s direction, had set
all plain sail. Fortunately Frank had remembered
the invisible riding-light on the forestay.</p>

<p>In the flat calm, although there was a light
swell on, the canvas hung idly. From the cockpit
only a part of the mainsail as far as the upper line
of reef-points and a small portion of the mizzen
were visible. The rest was swallowed up in the
fog.</p>

<p>“This is the worst fog we’ve struck,” remarked
Craddock, as he coiled up the lead-line for another
cast.</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed the Scoutmaster. “Luckily
we’ve plenty of sea-room.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of sea-room, sir?” echoed Peter.
“Where are we?”</p>

<p>“That, exactly, I don’t know,” confessed Mr.
Grant frankly. “What I do know is that we’ve
drifted right out of Falmouth Harbour and are in
the English Channel. As a rule fogs don’t last
very long at this time of year. When the sun is
well up there’ll be a breeze and the mist will
disperse. Meanwhile we must take things as we
find them and be thankful they are no worse.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> is doing,” remarked
Brandon.</p>

<p>“Still on her moorings, I expect,” hazarded
Heavitree. “They’ll think we’ve given them the
slip.”</p>

<p>“If the fog’s anything like it is here they won’t
know we’ve gone,” rejoined the Patrol Leader.
“Unless they hail us,” he added as an afterthought.
“Wonder why the cable parted? We
tested it carefully when we stowed it aboard the
first time.”</p>

<p>“This is the reason,” announced Mr. Grant,
producing the cut link from his pocket. “Someone
has been monkeying about with the chain.
It has been deliberately cut through with a hack-saw.
When and by whom remains a question.”</p>

<p>“Blueskin?” enquired Symington and Talbot
simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but unlikely,” replied the Scoutmaster.
“I’m basing my idea upon the assumption
that Carlo Bone has had a sea training. Some
miscreant, probably the fellow who squirted petrol
over the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, has an imaginary grievance
against us. He’s been trying to destroy the yacht
by the most underhanded methods imaginable.
Failing to set her on fire, he cut through this link,
knowing that it would still bear any ordinary
strain, but not a heavy one. He was counting
upon the cable parting while we were riding at
anchor in some harbour during a stiff gale. Now,
a seaman wouldn’t cut a link in that fashion—with
the cut away from the yacht’s bows. He would
saw through the other end of the link so that when
it did part it would go with the outboard portion
of the cable, and thus cover up all trace of his
underhand work.”</p>

<p>“But it might have been Blueskin,” remarked
Wilson.</p>

<p>“Yes, it might,” agreed Mr. Grant, “but
having misjudged him once I don’t feel justified
in laying the blame upon him. Not that we are
likely to discover the culprit. Now I think we
might see about a somewhat belated breakfast.”</p>

<p>While Talbot and Wilson, “the cooks of the
day,” went below to prepare the meal, the others
set about various tasks on deck. Craddock continued
to heave the lead at about five minutes’
intervals, the soundings remaining fairly regular.
Carline took over the manipulation of the fog-horn,
standing by the now useless tiller in case a
puff of wind should bear down through the
barrier of fog.</p>

<p>Brandon and Heavitree assisted the Scoutmaster
to bend the cable to the kedge. Fortunately
there still remained between fifteen and
twenty fathoms of the former, but in the absence
of a long link there was no means of shackling it
direct to the kedge—a small anchor of about
twenty-five pounds in weight. Consequently the
chain had to be made fast to the ring in the kedge
by a “fisherman’s bend,” the end being stopped
with wire to guard against any possibility of the
knot slipping.</p>

<p>“Brekker nearly ready?” enquired Brandon,
calling through the open skylight.</p>

<p>“It is,” replied Talbot, “but you won’t get
any till you’ve cleared up below.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed the Patrol Leader, “I’d
forgotten that! Come on, lads; let’s square up
and make all ship-shape below.”</p>

<p>The saloon was in a bit of an untidy state. The
Sea Scouts on their hurried exit for the deck had
tumbled out of bunks and hammocks, leaving the
former littered with blankets and the latter swaying
to and fro from the deck-beams. The bedding
was passed out, shaken, and folded; the hammocks
unshipped and stowed in their accustomed
places when not in use. Quickly the disordered
saloon assumed a semblance of tidiness.</p>

<p>“Where’s Molly?” enquired Brandon.</p>

<p>No one knew. She had been last seen asleep in
a box under Craddock’s bunk.</p>

<p>All hands below joined in the search. They
called the pup by name, hunted high and low, but
without success.</p>

<p>“S’pose she wasn’t in one of the blankets when
we shook them overboard?” suggested Heavitree.</p>

<p>“Now you mention it, I think I did hear a sort
of splash,” said Symington. “It was too thick
to see.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope not,” continued Heavitree. “She’s
not big enough to climb the companion ladder.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, lads?” enquired Mr. Grant,
entering the cabin and removing his dripping cap.</p>

<p>“We’ve lost Molly, sir,” announced Brandon
dolefully.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster sat down on one of the
settees. As he did so a growl of protest came
from the neighbourhood of his back. Turning,
he raised one of the side-cushions. There, in a
small recess formed between the two cushions,
was the missing pup together with about nine-tenths
of a shoe.</p>

<p>“Peter, old man!” sang out the Patrol Leader,
“Molly’s been lost. We’ve found her making a
meal of your shoe. Jolly careless of you to leave
your gear all over the place.”</p>

<p>Craddock, from whom the news of his special
pet’s disappearance had been hitherto kept,
temporarily abandoned his sounding operations
and came below.</p>

<p>“Naughty pup!” he said reprovingly.</p>

<p>Molly, no wise daunted, looked fearlessly up
into her master’s face and struggled to give him
a lick of devotion and affection.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t be so brave a week ago,” remarked
Brandon. “Don’t hit her, Peter.”</p>

<p>“No fear,” replied his chum. Then he critically
examined the damaged footgear.</p>

<p>“Strikes me, old son, you’ve made a slight
mistake,” he continued, addressing Brandon.
“It’s not my shoe; it’s yours.”</p>

<p>The others roared at the Patrol Leader’s discomfiture,
but Brandon took it in good part.</p>

<p>“That shows Molly’s sense of discrimination,”
he retorted, taking the shoe from Peter’s hand.
“It’s one of my second best. Where’s the other
one, I wonder?”</p>

<p>He searched and discovered it in his kit-bag,
together with one of his best shore-going pair. A
further hunt failed to find the other. Molly, with
her sense of discrimination, had taken two odd
ones from the Patrol Leader’s kit-bag, and of
these one had been thrown overboard by Symington
when he had shaken out his blankets. To
make matters worse the odd shoes were both lefts.</p>

<p>Breakfast was dispatched in grand style. The
Sea Scouts were in high spirits. The fact that
they were surrounded by fog hardly troubled
them. They were afloat in one of the soundest
craft imaginable for her size, and, what was more,
they were bound for the Jamboree. If necessary
they had sufficient provisions and fresh water for
a week.</p>

<p>Nor was Mr. Grant perturbed. Now that he
realised the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had plenty of sea-room, he had
little to worry about. On a still day such as this,
sounds could be heard for quite a long distance,
and since the continual roar of the Channel swell
against the iron-bound coast was inaudible he
knew that any danger of the yacht being cast
ashore by the strong and intricate currents of the
district was a remote one.</p>

<p>Noon came, bringing with it no breeze to disperse
the dense pall of mist. At times the fog
lifted sufficiently to enable the bowsprit-end to be
seen; at others it was a matter of difficulty to
distinguish objects six feet away.</p>

<p>The while the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was underlying in the
game of “chasing her own tail.” Absolutely
drifting in a dead calm, she was powerless to
answer to her helm. Her bows swung round very
slowly through every point of the compass and
continued to do so. Yet the while, judging by
the drag of the lead-line when allowed to remain
in the bottom, she was being swept in an easterly
direction by the two-knot tide. Well away to the
south’ard came an almost continual braying of
many sirens. The steamer track was as yet a safe
distance off.</p>

<p>By two in the afternoon the crew began to find
time hang heavily on their hands. The reaction
of having nothing definite to do following upon
days of strenuous activity from morn to night was
telling. They could see nothing beyond the
limits of their floating home, and hardly that.
There was plenty to be done by way of “finishing
off” various jobs below, but the light was too dim
to enable anything in that line to be attempted.
They coiled down or “flemished” every rope on
deck, spun yarns, tried to teach their overfed and
decidedly sleepy mascot various tricks—all without
success.</p>

<p>“Wish the fog would lift,” remarked Carline.</p>

<p>“And a breeze spring up,” added Heavitree,
looking wistfully at the idle canvas.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster, too, was puzzled, not only
by the persistency of the fog, but by the absence
of sound from any of the shore signal stations. In
vain he kept listening for the fog signals from the
Lizard. That dangerous headland might be only
a few miles away and yet the sound be inaudible.
Fog, he knew, plays strange tricks with sound.
Frequently there are zones of silence over which
sounds leap to be distinctly audible at a long distance
beyond the source of emission. All he knew
concerning the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> position was that she was
drifting slowly in a south-easterly direction, but
that on the turn of the Channel tide—which by
no means coincided with the time of high and low
water on the shore—the yacht would be swept in
the reverse direction and possibly be driven
aground on the dangerous coast between the
Lizard and the Manacles.</p>

<p>No wonder he wished fervently for the fog to
lift.</p>

<p>The hours passed slowly. It was not until
nearly eight o’clock that a faint breeze ruffled the
water and the wall of vapour began to disperse.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! a breeze!” exclaimed Brandon, as
the hitherto idly-playing main boom swung out
and tugged gently at the mainsheet.</p>

<p>“What course, sir?” asked the Patrol Leader,
as the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> gathered way.</p>

<p>“Sou’-sou’-east,” replied Mr. Grant. “It’ll
mean a night afloat, lads.”</p>

<p>“Good egg!” ejaculated Heavitree.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster wasn’t so sure about it.
Possibly there would be half a gale of wind when
the fog did disperse; and until it did the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
must have plenty of sea-room. To attempt to
make a strange harbour in a mist and with only
a few remaining hours of daylight was asking for
trouble.</p>

<p>The breeze held; but the mist, although
diminishing in density, continued to hang about
in irregular patches.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes skinned, lads!” continued
Mr. Grant. “We ought to be seeing land on our
port quarter.”</p>

<p>“Sail ahead!” sang out Craddock.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER VII &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Derelict</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“D</span>own</span> helm!” ordered Brandon, in his
capacity of officer of the starboard watch.
“At that! Keep her so!”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, answering readily to a slight
pressure on the tiller, changed her course to bring
the other craft on her port bow.</p>

<p>“If we pass within hailing distance they might
be able to give us our position,” remarked the
Patrol Leader.</p>

<p>Quickly the stranger loomed up in the dispersing
mist, for by this time visibility extended to nearly
a quarter of a mile. She turned out to be a
schooner. Her topsails were furled, but her fore
and aft canvas was set, the head-sails being to
wind’ard. Under these conditions she was “hove-to”
with a decided list to port.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> announced
her approach by three blasts of her fog-horn,
for the wind was well abaft the beam. No
reply came from the schooner.</p>

<p>“Careless look-out, what?” observed Peter.</p>

<p>“I fancy there’s something amiss,” replied
Brandon. “There doesn’t seem to be anyone on
board. What shall we do, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant, thus appealed to, shook his
head.</p>

<p>“You’re standing your trick, Brandon,” he replied.
“Officially I’m not on duty. Use your
own discretion.”</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader warmed at the implied
compliment. He knew the Scoutmaster’s views.
As far as prudence dictated, Mr. Grant left the
seamanship entirely to his youthful crew. It was
the best way to enable them to gain confidence in
themselves. He was merely a sort of referee,
ready to assist by advice and deed should the Sea
Scouts commit any serious error. Not that they
often did. He had great confidence in the skill
and resourcefulness of his crew.</p>

<p>“Stand by to go about!” ordered Brandon.
“We’ll run under her lee and see if anything is
wrong with her.”</p>

<p>Full and bye, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> passed a full hundred
yards to lee’ard of the schooner, and then the
mystery was in part solved. The vessel had been
in collision. Most of her counter had been carried
away, the damage extending almost, if not quite,
to the water line. She was well down by the stern—possibly
not far short of foundering. There was
no sign of a boat. Apparently the crew had abandoned
her and had either made for the shore or
else had been picked up by the craft that had run
the schooner down. Owing to the severe damage
to the stern, her name and port of registry were
not to be seen, but by the yellow letters on her
bow the derelict proclaimed herself to be the
<span class='it'>Euterpe</span>.</p>

<p>“That name seems familiar,” thought Mr.
Grant. “Where have I heard that? I remember.
Old Richard Marner told me his son was on her—<span class='it'>Huterp</span>,
he pronounced the name.”</p>

<p>“Lee-o!” ordered Brandon. “Head sheets
to wind’ard! Gather in your mainsheet
roundly!”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> went about slowly yet unhesitatingly
and hove-to on the starboard tack within fifty
yards of the <span class='it'>Euterpe’s</span> starboard quarter.</p>

<p>“I’ll send the dinghy off to her, sir,” said the
Patrol Leader. “There might be someone on
board.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” agreed Mr. Grant. “I’ll take charge
of the dinghy. We must be very careful how we
go alongside. She won’t last very much longer,
I fancy.”</p>

<p>The boat was hauled up alongside the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.
Into her jumped the Scoutmaster and Craddock
and Heavitree.</p>

<p>A few strokes brought the dinghy to the abandoned
schooner. She was so low aft that it was
quite an easy matter to board her by the main
chains. The Scoutmaster did so, bidding the two
lads hang on, but to be ready to push off should
the vessel show a tendency to hasten her departure
to Davy Jones’ locker.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as he gained the deck, Mr. Grant
caught sight of a black cat sitting close to the
companion leading to the cabin.</p>

<p>“There’s a cat aboard, lads!” he announced,
going to the rail and addressing the crew of the
dinghy. “I’ll hand it down to you.”</p>

<p>“At this rate we’ll have a regular menagerie
on the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> before we reach Chichester
Harbour,” remarked Peter to his companion.
“Hope the animal will make friends with
Molly.”</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster walked slowly towards the cat,
calling “Puss, puss!” in a coaxing tone. The
animal, however, showed no enthusiasm at the
prospect of being rescued. In fact, it evinced a
decided reluctance to do so; and, waiting until
Mr. Grant was within a couple of yards or so, it
turned and bolted down the ladder.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant followed. It was a risky business
going below, with the schooner in danger of
making a sudden plunge.</p>

<p>At the foot of the companion ladder was a
small lobby with two doors. The starboard
door was shut; the other one ajar. Obviously
the cat had taken refuge in the cabin on the port
side.</p>

<p>Before pursuing the animal, the Scoutmaster
opened the door of the starboard or captain’s cabin.
Everything was in order. The skipper must have
been on deck when the collision occurred and had
not waited to save his personal belongings before
taking to the boat.</p>

<p>Closing the door, Mr. Grant stepped into the
other cabin. At the after end pale daylight
showed through the jagged gap in the counter.
Water gurgled sullenly under the floor, a portion
of which had been violently up-heaved by
the compact, causing the swing table to be
capsized together with a quantity of splintered
woodwork.</p>

<p>“Puss! puss!” he called again. “Bother the
animal! Where’s it got to?”</p>

<p>Suddenly the Scoutmaster caught sight of a
man’s legs protruding from the pile of debris.
The occupant of the cabin had been caught and
pinned down—crushed more than likely—by the
sudden and unexpected blow of the colliding
vessel’s bows.</p>

<p>A few minutes’ desperate work enabled Mr.
Grant to remove most of the tightly wedged woodwork
and disentangle the motionless form of the
luckless man. Then, without waiting to see
whether he were alive or dead, the Scoutmaster
dragged him out of the cabin, up the steep and
narrow ladder, and across the deck.</p>

<p>“Stand by, Peter!” he exclaimed breathlessly,
and passing a bowline round the unconscious
form, he unceremoniously lowered him into the
dinghy.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a look into the forepeak in case
there’s anyone else!” he announced.</p>

<p>“Where’s the cat, sir?” shouted Craddock,
after the retreating form of his Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>The question was answered by the animal itself.
Springing on the bulwarks, the cat leapt fearlessly
into the boat and proceeded to curl itself upon
the chest of the motionless figure in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Grant returned.</p>

<p>“No one else is aboard,” he reported. “Hello!
You’ve got the cat, I see!”</p>

<p>Cautiously he lowered himself into the dinghy
and crouched in the bows. There was no room
aft.</p>

<p>“Push off, and give way, lads!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>By this time the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had forged ahead and
had increased her distance to about a cable’s
length. The dinghy had not covered more than
two-thirds of the distance when the stricken
<span class='it'>Euterpe</span> disappeared beneath the surface.</p>

<p>She went with very little fuss. There was a
slight explosion of compressed air, followed by a
swirling movement of the water. There appeared
to be very little suction and hardly any commotion
in the form of breaking waves; but—and Mr.
Grant gave an inward prayer of thanks—the
schooner had heeled to starboard as she disappeared.
Had the dinghy been close alongside
she would have been crushed by the vessel’s mainmast
or else entangled in the still set canvas as the
schooner capsized.</p>

<p>The rowers rested on their oars and watched
the vessel’s disappearance with awestruck faces.</p>

<p>“That was a close shave for us,” said Heavitree,
breaking the silence.</p>

<p>“It was,” agreed Mr. Grant. “Give way;
another dozen strokes will do the trick.”</p>

<p>The dinghy ranged up alongside the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.
Craddock and Heavitree held on while the Scoutmaster
handed the heavy burden of the motionless
man to the ready arms of Brandon and his companions.</p>

<p>The dinghy was made fast by the painter, but
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was still kept hove-to while the crew
attended to the rescued man.</p>

<p>“He’s still alive,” declared Mr. Grant. “That’s
what stunned him.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a nasty gash in the man’s temple
from which the blood was flowing slowly. In fact,
it had almost ceased to do so, indicating that the
injury had been done at least two hours ago. In
addition, his right foot was badly nipped, with a
superficial but nasty graze extending the whole
length of the shin-bone.</p>

<p>“No fracture,” pronounced Mr. Grant after a
careful examination of the limbs. “First aid
dressings, please, Brandon. We’ll leave him in
the cockpit till he recovers consciousness, but keep
his body and limbs warm with blankets. He’d
better have my bunk to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why, your hand’s bleeding, sir,” exclaimed
Carline.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster glanced at his right hand.
There was a small scratch extending from the
base of the middle finger almost to the centre of
the palm.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” he remarked. “I expect I
caught the business end of a piece of splintered
wood. I didn’t even feel it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Get way on her,
Peter! Same course, please; we can’t do better
than that.”</p>

<p>Presently, judging by sounds emanating from
the saloon, Molly and the cat were “having a few
words.” The pup was barking shrilly, while the
other animal, with arched back, was replying in no
uncertain voice.</p>

<p>“Let them alone, and they’ll make friends,”
remarked Peter to Talbot, who had expressed his
intention of going below and separating the
“menagerie.” “The more you jolly well interfere
the worse they’ll be—sort of showing off.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the sea superstition will hold good
in our case,” asked Carline. “They say a black
cat on board a ship always brings a gale of
wind.”</p>

<p>Craddock glanced astern. Twilight was stealing
over the misty sea. Through the gathering
gloom came a dismal whine—the sound that often
heralds the approach of a squall.</p>

<p>“We haven’t long to wait for it, lads!” he
exclaimed, making a spring for the cleated mainsheet.
“It’s here now!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER VIII &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Man they Rescued</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was in an unfavourable position
to withstand the first of the squall. She
was running almost dead before the present breeze.
Should the blast come from even a slightly
different direction there was the great risk of an
involuntary gybe. The main and mizzen booms
would swing over with terrific force and either
carry away the runners or else spring one or both
masts.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Craddock kept his head. Shouting
to Talbot to ease the head-sheets, he put the helm
down gently.</p>

<p>The squall came. In spite of the canvas shaking
as the wind “spilled” it, the ketch heeled till her
lee rail was awash; then, recovering, she leapt
forward like a racehorse as Peter cautiously took
a strain on the mainsheet.</p>

<p>At a warning shout, Mr. Grant hurried up from
below, saw what Craddock had done, and nodded
approval.</p>

<p>“She’s as stiff as a house,” he exclaimed reassuringly.
“All the same, we’ll have the mizzen
sail off of her while it’s still light .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the big
jib as well. Bear a hand, Brandon, to get our
patient below. He may get knocked about if he
remains here.”</p>

<p>The injured man was showing signs of returning
consciousness. He moaned as he was being
lifted, opened his eyes, and gazed blankly into the
Scoutmaster’s face.</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” said Mr. Grant consolingly.</p>

<p>The patient closed his eyes and gave no further
sign of movement. With difficulty, owing to the
erratic motion of the yacht, they carried him down
the narrow companion way and into the Scoutmaster’s
cabin.</p>

<p>While this was being done Craddock put the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> into the wind and hove-to, while canvas
was being reduced. Stowing and furling the
mizzen sail was accomplished with little difficulty;
but the task of taking in the No. 1 jib and substituting
the No. 3 took some doing. The yacht
pitched so violently in the rapidly rising sea that
Heavitree and Symington, on whom this task
devolved, were frequently waist-deep in water as
they knelt on the fore-deck and struggled with
out-haul and jib-halliards and sought to muzzle
the fiercely flapping canvas.</p>

<p>At last the business of reducing sail was accomplished,
and the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> put on her former course.
With whole mainsail, staysail, and baby-jib she
made splendid weather of it. In fact, she could
have stood more canvas; but in view of night
approaching it was prudent to keep her well under
control, especially as the now hard wind might
increase in force.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the side-lights had been placed in
position. Both had been tested during the process
of fitting out, but now for some unaccountable
reason the starboard lamp refused to keep alight.</p>

<p>“This is no light matter on a dark night,” said
Heavitree. “No joke intended, Peter! Any good
trying a handkerchief round the ventilation holes?”</p>

<p>“Might do it,” replied Craddock. “It seems
as if the thing isn’t getting enough air as it is.
However, see what you can do.”</p>

<p>Cautiously making his way for’ard, Heavitree
grasped the shrouds with one hand and with the
other removed the lamp from the screen. He had
to take it into the saloon to relight it, and at the
same time he wound his handkerchief loosely
round the lower part of the lamp. Almost as soon
as he regained the cockpit the light went out.</p>

<p>“You’re whacked, old son!” exclaimed Craddock.</p>

<p>“Am I—you see!” retorted Heavitree as he
went below again with the extinguished lamp.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he returned with the green
light gleaming exceptionally brightly. Curiously
Peter watched his chum go for’ard, expecting every
second to see the light vanish. It didn’t.</p>

<p>Heavitree refixed the lamp and came aft. It
gave no further trouble. The resourceful Sea
Scout had removed the oil reservoir and had substituted
his small electric flash lamp.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was now maintaining quite a good
speed. Peter took it to be at least eight knots, but
perhaps like most amateurs he was apt to overestimate
the vessel’s rate. In spite of the curling,
crested waves, she came through with hardly any
water on her decks, and although at times the
following seas appeared high and menacing, she
rode them in a manner that gave everyone the
greatest confidence in her seagoing qualities.</p>

<p>“Light on the port bow, sir!” reported
Wilson.</p>

<p>“Your eyes are sharper than mine, then,” rejoined
the Scoutmaster, after a prolonged look in
the direction indicated.</p>

<p>“There it is again, sir,” declared the lad.
“Two quick flashes!”</p>

<p>“I see them, too,” added Talbot.</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Mr. Grant. “Well, now
we know where we are, more or less. That’s the
Eddystone.”</p>

<p>He took a rough compass bearing and went
below to apply the reading to the chart. The
result rather surprised him. According to the
calculation, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> ought to have been farther
to the south’ard. Either there was considerable
deviation of the compass, or else the yacht had
been carried northwards by a tidal current. Leeway
did not enter into the problem, as the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
had been running free—except for two brief
intervals—from the time she picked up the
breeze.</p>

<p>It was something to be able to pick up the
Eddystone light, but the knowledge alone could
not determine the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> position. A second
bearing cutting the first as near as possible at right
angles would fix that.</p>

<p>By the aid of his night glasses, the Scoutmaster
swept the horizon away to the nor’ard,
hoping to pick up St. Catherine’s light at the
entrance to Fowey Harbour. But the night was
still hazy, and the light was invisible.</p>

<p>A tramp steamer passed at about a cable’s
length to port. The moon emerging from a bank
of scudding clouds showed her plunging heavily
into the head seas. Frequently showers of
glistening spray completely hid her bows and flew
high over her bridge. Yet the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, flying
before the wind, was making easy weather of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant was now confronted with a difficult
problem: whether to carry on or to bear up and
run for shelter into Plymouth Sound. On first
thoughts he favoured the latter alternative. With
an injured man on board, and having several
hours before dawn to make for shelter, this seemed
the obvious thing to do. Then he considered the
difficulties. He had never been into Plymouth
before. He was a stranger to the intricate currents
inside the breakwater. The Sound and Hamoaze
were generally crowded with shipping. The
numerous navigation and riding-lamps were apt
to be particularly perplexing to a stranger, and
there was no small risk of disaster should an error
of judgment occur.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was proving
herself to be a capital sea-boat. Better then to
hold on, keeping plenty of sea-room, and gain the
sheltered waters of Start Bay at daybreak.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant chose the latter alternative and stuck
to it. Indecision he held to be worse than incompetence.
A person in charge of a vessel and unable
to make up his mind was a menace to his crew;
an incompetent skipper, although a despicable
character, could be superseded in a critical
situation by a better man.</p>

<p>Keeping Craddock and Heavitree on deck, the
Scoutmaster took the helm and told the rest of
the crew to turn in. The two hefty Sea Scouts
were sufficient to assist him in the management of
the yacht in a stiff blow at night. The others
would only be in the way. In addition they would
be as limp as rags in the morning.</p>

<p>At 1 a.m. the Eddystone was abeam at a distance
of about two miles. It was still too hazy to
pick up the powerful Start light, and there was no
object in “cracking on” and arriving off that
dangerous headland before dawn.</p>

<p>Accordingly a couple of reefs were taken in the
mainsail, and the staysail was lowered and
“bonneted” to the bowsprit. Even then the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> maintained a fair speed and rode the waves
like a cork, with the dinghy’s bows high in the air
as she strained at the end of a double length of
stout 50-feet rope.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this top-hole, sir?” exclaimed Peter
enthusiastically. “I’d rather be in the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
than in that tramp which passed us some time
ago.”</p>

<p>Before the Scoutmaster could offer any remark
Brandon came out of the cabin.</p>

<p>“The man has come to,” he announced oracularly.</p>

<p>“How does he feel? Did he say?” asked Mr.
Grant.</p>

<p>“Said he was thirsty, sir.”</p>

<p>Telling Craddock to take the helm, Mr. Grant
went below.</p>

<p>He found the rescued man quite rational in
spite of the serious injury to his head. Reiterating
the fact that he was thirsty, he continued by asking
where he was.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster explained.</p>

<p>“You’re quite safe,” he continued. “But I’m
afraid you’ll have to put up with the limited
accommodation on board until we can put you
ashore. I’ll give you something to drink; after
that you must try all you can to get to sleep.”</p>

<p>“It du seem queer loike tu wake up an’ find
myself here,” said the man, as he watched the
preparation of the beverage. “Last I remember
wur I wur sittin’ in——”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that now,” interrupted
Mr. Grant. “After you’ve slept a few hours it
will be interesting to hear your story. What’s
your name, by the by?”</p>

<p>“Marner—Dick Marner,” was the not altogether
unexpected reply.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER IX &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>What Marner Revealed</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“L</span>ight</span> on our port bow, sir!” reported
Craddock.</p>

<p>“How far off?” asked Mr. Grant, through the
open skylight.</p>

<p>“Miles, sir,” replied Peter. “Another lighthouse,
I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Good! I’ll be on deck in a minute,” rejoined
the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>Having reassured himself that Marner was comfortable
and almost on the point of falling asleep,
Mr. Grant left the cabin and entered the saloon.
Here he paused and held his hand close to the
swinging lamp.</p>

<p>“H’m!” he remarked in an undertone, as he
examined the somewhat jagged cut. “It’s a case
of the cobbler being the worst shod, I suppose.
I’m always impressing upon the boys the absolute
necessity of guarding against blood-poisoning, and
in my case it’s precept without practice. Better
late than never: I’ll smother the gash with
iodine.”</p>

<p>He opened the medicine-chest, found and uncorked
the iodine bottle.</p>

<p>“Finger’s throbbing already, I fancy,” he continued.</p>

<p>“How’s your hand, sir?” asked Brandon.
“Let me bind it up for you.”</p>

<p>“Thought you were sound asleep, Frank,”
remarked the Scoutmaster. “Thanks awfully,
if you will.”</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader slipped out of his bunk and,
taking the bottle, poured a few drops into the
jagged wound. The sting of the iodine made
Mr. Grant wince.</p>

<p>“That ought to do the trick, sir,” continued
Brandon. “I’ll put a bandage round your hand.
I wouldn’t use it if I were you; but there, you
know all about that sort of thing, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m supposed to,” admitted the Scoutmaster.
“Unfortunately, when it comes to a personal
matter one is apt to let such things slide. That’s
quite comfortable. Now I’ll see what the watch
on deck are doing.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me, sir?” asked Brandon. “I’ll
turn out, if you like. I’d be only too pleased
to.”</p>

<p>“No need,” replied Mr. Grant. “Sleep while
you can. I may want you when we enter harbour,
but that may be hours yet.”</p>

<p>Going on deck, Mr. Grant found that the light
Peter had reported was two points on the port
bow. By the nature of the flashes—one every
second—he recognised it as The Start.</p>

<p>“We’re timing things very nicely,” he observed.
“By the time that light’s abeam, it will be dawn.
Then we’ll have to close haul in the first tack and
get under the lee of the line. We’ll make for Dartmouth
and land our passenger. He’s just told me
his name is Marner, son of old Dick Marner.”</p>

<p>“The pal of Blueskin Bone, sir?”</p>

<p>“Hope not,” replied Mr. Grant, laughing.
“The old man denied the acquaintanceship.
However, that’s done with; Blueskin fades out
of the picture like a bad dream.”</p>

<p>Almost before the fact could be realised dawn
broke. A rosy flush spread over the north-eastern
sky, revealing a turmoil of angry, grey-crested
waves, for the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was only a mile or
so to the south’ard of The Start, and was feeling
the effect of the weather-going tide surging over
the ledge of submerged rocks, extending from
that bold and dangerous headland.</p>

<p>The yacht was rolling heavily as she ran, but
her seaworthiness was now fully established. She
was making better weather of it than a vessel of
three or four times her tonnage.</p>

<p>“Nor’east a quarter north, now,” ordered the
Scoutmaster. “A pull on the mainsheet, Heavitree.
I’ll see to the head-sheets.”</p>

<p>Craddock put the helm down. Round came the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> until the youthful helmsman “met her”
on the required course. She was now almost, but
not quite, close-hauled. The rolling motion gave
place to a fairly steady heel. Showers of spray
flew inboard over her weather bow, while her lee-bow
wave creamed and frothed in a way that gave
a fairly true indication of the speed she was
making. After running for hours the sense of
being close-hauled was unmistakably thrilling.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she hopping it, eh?” exclaimed Heavitree,
as he coiled down the flake of the mainsheet.
“Hello, sir! Look what you’ve done.”</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster followed the direction of the
Sea Scout’s glance. The bandage on his hand
was dyed red.</p>

<p>“Must have opened the cut when I handled the
jib-sheet,” he thought. “Well, it’s a good thing
it was covered up; no dirt can get to it.”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing much,” he remarked casually.
“Now, you fellows, let’s see who has the keenest
eyesight. There should be a conical buoy on our
port bow about a couple of miles off.”</p>

<p>“I see it, sir!” exclaimed Heavitree almost at
once. “It’s dead on with our bowsprit-end.”</p>

<p>“Is it, by Jove!” ejaculated Mr. Grant. “Up
helm, Peter! At that! We’re closer in than I
thought. We might have piled the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> on
The Skerries. See those houses just under The
Start? That’s Beesands, or what’s left of it.
Most of the village was washed away in a gale.
The fishermen there train dogs to swim out to
the returning boats and swim back with a line.
It takes some doing in a rough sea. We’re in
smoother water now. Do you see that high point
of land ahead, Peter? Steer for that; never mind
the compass.”</p>

<p>Pointing out various places of interest ashore,
Mr. Grant chatted briskly in order to arouse the
obviously flagging spirits of the two lads. They
had stuck it well during the night watches, and
now they kicked against the suggestion that they
should go below to be relieved by Brandon and
Talbot.</p>

<p>“Why not bother about the compass, sir?”
asked Peter.</p>

<p>“Because for the present it isn’t absolutely
necessary,” explained Mr. Grant. “When you’ve
a fixed object to steer by, it saves the strain of
peering into the binnacle-hood. You fellows have
had quite enough of that to-night, or rather last
night. Now, Heavitree, nip below and get the
stove going. Nothing like a cup of hot cocoa in
the early morning after a long trick. When it’s
ready, tell Brandon to turn out. We’ll want an
extra hand if we have to beat in. This wind will
head us, I fancy, when we’re abreast the Homestone.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was now so steady that Heavitree
had no difficulty in lighting the stove. In about
ten minutes his tousled head appeared, framed in
the companion.</p>

<p>“Cocoa’s ready, sir,” he announced, “and all
the others are awake and want cocoa too.”</p>

<p>“You want me, sir?” asked Brandon, as he
edged past Heavitree in the companion.</p>

<p>“Yes, please,” replied Mr. Grant. “Have
your cocoa and a biscuit first, then tell the others
to get their breakfasts when they’re dressed. We
don’t want too many on deck, if we’ve to tack in.
And, while you are about it, you might hand me
the chart of Dartmouth Harbour.”</p>

<p>Six o’clock was striking as the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, at one
moment heeling to the fierce blasts that swept
down from the lofty ground and at another
gliding with canvas hanging idly in a flat calm,
made her way between the twin castles of St.
Petrox and Kingswear, and gained the land-locked
harbour of Dartmouth. Fortunately the
first of the flood tide was setting in, and without
much difficulty the yacht gained its anchorage.</p>

<p>“There’s a vacant buoy,” observed Mr. Grant,
pointing to one a short distance astern of a small
tramp steamer. “We’ll pick it up. It will be
much safer than riding to a kedge. We’ll have to
get another anchor some time to-day, and the
sooner the better. Now, Brandon, let’s see how
you come up to moorings.”</p>

<p>Considering the Patrol Leader was as yet almost
a stranger to the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> capabilities he managed
remarkably well. Judging the distance to a nicety,
he put the helm down and shot the yacht up into
the wind. Heavitree running for’ard picked up
the buoy with a boat-hook, and hauling in the
buoy rope passed the mooring chain round the
bitts before the yacht had time to “fall off.”</p>

<p>“Well done!” exclaimed Mr. Grant approvingly.
“Down canvas! Then breakfast and a
jolly good sound sleep!”</p>

<p>“Could do with both, sir,” agreed Craddock
feelingly.</p>

<p>But the Scoutmaster had much to do before he
could enjoy an already well-earned rest. As soon
as the post-office opened he went ashore in the
dinghy and telegraphed to old Marner the news
of his son’s safety. Also he had to report the
matter to the Registrar of Shipping. He then took
the opportunity of communicating with Scoutmaster
Pendennis at Falmouth, acquainting him
of the fact that the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had arrived at Dartmouth
under somewhat unusual conditions and
expressing a hope that even yet the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> and
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> would be able to cruise in company.</p>

<p>His next business was to make arrangements
with the local representative of the Shipwrecked
Mariners Aid Society, to have Dick Marner taken
ashore and sent home by train.</p>

<p>Finally, he bought another anchor to replace
the one lying on the bed of Falmouth Harbour.</p>

<p>He returned on board to find all the crew asleep
with the exception of Carline, who had been told
off to keep anchor watch.</p>

<p>“You’d better turn in, too, Carline,” said Mr.
Grant. “We aren’t getting under way to-day, and
perhaps not to-morrow either. We want fair
weather for the run past Portland Bill, and,
judging by this morning’s sunrise, we aren’t going
to get it just at present.”</p>

<p>Going to his own cabin, Mr. Grant saw that
Marner was awake.</p>

<p>“Feelin’ fine, sir,” replied the man in answer
to the Scoutmaster’s enquiry. “But I’m fair
hungry. That beef tea was all very well, but it
don’t fill a man’s innards, in a manner o’ speakin’,
sir. Can’t I have somethin’ as ’as got summat to
bite at?”</p>

<p>“I think so, now,” said Mr. Grant, smiling at
the Cornishman’s quaintly phrased request. “And
a boat’s coming for you some time before noon.
You’ll be given your fare to Falmouth, and with
luck you’ll be home to-night. But you’ll have to
be careful with that head of yours, and not shake
yourself up too much on your motor bike.”</p>

<p>A look of bewilderment spread over the bronzed
features of Dick Marner, junior.</p>

<p>“Moty bike, sir?” he rejoined. “Can’t say
as I follers what you’m meaning.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Grant’s turn to look surprised.
Could it be that Marner was suffering from partial
loss of memory owing to the injury to his head?</p>

<p>“Surely you remember your motor bicycle at
your father’s place at Polkebo?”</p>

<p>“Never ’ad a moty bicycle in my life, sir,” was
the astounding reply. “Couldn’t ride un if I ’ad.”</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster made no comment, but
thought the more. Apparently the situation required
careful handling, but before he could frame
a suitable question, Dick Marner continued:</p>

<p>“Now I comes to think on it, the moty cycle
you seed was Blueskin Bone’s. ’E an’ fayther are
neighbours like; an’ Blueskin ain’t got no shed in
’is garden, and ’aving trouble to get moty cycle up
the girt steps to ’is door, ’e keeps un in fayther’s
shed.”</p>

<p>“So that’s it,” thought Mr. Grant. “I wish
I’d known that when I interviewed Mr. Marner,
senior, the sly old rascal! However, Blueskin’s a
back number as far as we are concerned. That’s
something to be thankful for.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER X &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Blueskin’s Plot</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> presence of the Aberstour Sea Scouts’
yacht <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> in Dartmouth Harbour attracted
a fair amount of interest, but none more
than that shown by a tall, heavily built, and loose-jowled
deck-hand on board the <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span>.</p>

<p>Leaning over the bulwark of the tramp and
shading his face with his hands, the man gazed so
intently at the newly arrived yacht that one of his
shipmates was struck by his studied interest.</p>

<p>“Lor’, Blueskin!” he exclaimed. “Wot’s
strikin’ your fancy now? Ain’t you never seen
a crowd o’ Sea Scoutses afore?”</p>

<p>Carlo Bone spat contemptuously into the
scuppers.</p>

<p>“Axin’ for trouble, them is,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“An’ so’ll you be if the Old Man sees you
hangin’ on to the slack,” rejoined the other.
“Bear a hand an’ help shift this ’ere dunnage.”</p>

<p>The <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span> was lying within a hundred
yards of the mooring which the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had picked
up. She had arrived a few days before, having
developed engine trouble in that antiquated box
which required all the skill and patience of a dour
Scots engineer to take the old tramp along at even
a modest five knots.</p>

<p>The sight of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> acted like a red rag to
a mad bull as far as Blueskin Bone was concerned.
The mere knowledge that had it not been for
“them Sea Scoutses” he might have become the
owner of the craft never ceased to anger him.
Even when, acting upon the idea that Polkebo was
getting too hot for him, he had shipped aboard
the <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span> his resentment did not die
down; it merely smouldered, to be revived to
white heat when, quite unexpectedly, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
came in with the flood tide from the boisterous
waters of the English Channel.</p>

<p>“If she ain’t mine,” he muttered, “she won’t
be nobody’s—not if I can ’elp it. Too mighty
cute those chaps wur last time—when they thought
as I wur about. If they don’t see I, maybe they
won’t be so plaguey wideawake.”</p>

<p>For the rest of his watch Blueskin spent most
of the time taking furtive glances at the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
and cudgelling his brains to devise some cunning
plan to gain his ends. In order to conceal himself
from observation from the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, he even declined
to go ashore that evening, much to his
shipmates’ surprise.</p>

<p>Long after the hands had turned in that night
Blueskin lay awake. When at length silence
reigned in the stuffy fo’c’sle of the <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span>,
Carlo Bone slipped out of his bunk, barefooted
and wearing only a pair of canvas trousers.</p>

<p>It was a pitch dark night. Heavy clouds overspread
the sky. A hard blow was raging out in
the Channel, and even the land-locked waters of
Dartmouth Harbour were foam-flecked. The
flood tide was on the point of turning. In fact,
all the shipping at anchor on the Kingswear side
were riding head to wind. Eighty yards or so
away, the riding-light of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> see-sawed as
the yacht rolled and strained at her borrowed
moorings.</p>

<p>Groping about in the darkness, Blueskin soon
found what he wanted: an iron bucket to which
he had previously attached a short length of
flexible steel wire. The bucket he lowered over
the ship’s side by means of a piece of spun yarn
until it hung just above the surface.</p>

<p>Giving a final look round to reassure himself
that no one was on deck, Blueskin lowered himself
into the water. Then, casting off the lashing
that held the bucket, he struck out for the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>,
pushing the bucket in front of him.</p>

<p>Like most Cornishmen, Blueskin Bone was a
powerful swimmer, and an expert diver. It was
mere child’s-play to him to swim to the yacht’s
stern, partly fill the bucket to make it float upright,
and then to dive with the free end of the flexible
wire in his grasp.</p>

<p>Blueskin had seen the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> high and dry so
often that he was well acquainted with the way in
which her rudder fastenings were fixed. In the
darkness the task he had in hand presented no
difficulty. Quickly he passed the end of the wire
between the rudder and the stern-post just above
the lower pintle, and came to the surface with the
steel rope still in his hand.</p>

<p>His next act was to bend the end of the wire to
the handle of the bucket, so that both extremities
were secured close together. The bucket was now
firmly attached to the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> rudder by the
doubled parts of the wire.</p>

<p>“That’ll ’old till the crows come ’ome,” he
muttered, as he tugged at the last hitch of the
rope.</p>

<p>Tilting the bucket, Blueskin allowed it to fill
and sink. It was now suspended at the end of a
few feet of steel wire immediately under the
yacht’s stern-post.</p>

<p>Having accomplished what he had set out to do,
Carlo Bone swam back to the <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span>, swarmed
up her side, removed and wrung out his trousers,
and crept back to his bunk.</p>

<p>“Reckon I ain’t cried quits wi’ ’em yet,” he
muttered, recalling with mingled feelings of
humiliation and anger the incident when he was
knocked out by a mere youth. “ ’Tany rate, I’ve
done summat t’wards gettin’ my own back. Like
as not them’ll have a leadin’ wind outer ’ere when
them starts. An’ a fair tide. But when it comes
tu goin’ about like in the Range, that there bucket’ll
make ’em miss stays. They’ll be fair on the rocks
afore they knows where they be.”</p>

<p>There was deep cunning in Carlo Bone’s plan.
He counted upon the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> getting under way
with a fair wind and a fair tide. The crew would
not be likely to notice that they were towing a
bucket under the stern, although the drag would
be considerable. But in the Narrows, at the
entrance to the harbour, the baffling wind and the
set of the tidal current would compel the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
to attempt at least one tack. Then the impediment
caused by the bucket would be more than
sufficient to make her “miss stays,” and in that
hopeless state she would be driven upon the saw-edged
rocks to lee’ard almost before her crew
realised their danger.</p>

<p>Chuckling sardonically, Blueskin lay awake in
his bunk until nearly dawn—the dawn of a day
on which, if his plans went aright, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
would ignominiously end her career upon the
rock-strewn coast of Devon.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XI &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>How it Failed</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“A</span>ll</span> clear for’ard?” shouted Patrol Leader
Brandon. “Stand by to let go!”</p>

<p>Fifty hours had elapsed since the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> found
her way into Dartmouth Harbour. The summer
storm had blown itself out. The Sea Scouts,
having made up arrears of sleep, were in the best
of spirits and keenly looking forward to the long
run across West Bay and round the famous Bill
of Portland.</p>

<p>It was almost a flat calm. The tide was
still ebbing. The <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span> remained at
anchor, repairs to her machinery being still in
progress.</p>

<p>According to his rule of letting the Sea Scouts
work their craft as far as possible entirely on their
own responsibility, Mr. Grant was acting in the
rôle of passenger, Patrol Leader Frank Brandon
being for the present skipper of the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>“Get an oar out, Heavitree,” continued the
Patrol Leader. “We’ll have to sweep her round
in this light breeze, and probably tow her clear of
the harbour. She’ll shift easily enough when once
we get way on her.”</p>

<p>Brandon was on the point of calling to Carline
to cast off the mooring when he noticed a small
motor boat approaching, apparently with the intention
of crossing the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> bows. Instead,
the owner of the power-craft reversed, put her
helm over, and ran alongside.</p>

<p>“Good morning!” he exclaimed. “I see you
fellows are off. Perhaps you’d like a tow? I’m
off to the East Blockstone to try a bit of fishing,
so if you like I’ll take a line.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully, sir,” replied Brandon. “It’s
jolly good of you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” rejoined the owner of the motor
boat. “Matter of fact, I used to be a Scoutmaster.
Had to give it up, unfortunately. However, I still
stick to the practice of ‘One Good Turn a Day’—more
if I have a chance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sorry, I didn’t see
you,” he added, addressing Mr. Grant, who had
just come out of the saloon. “Why! Surely your
name’s Grant?”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” was the reply, “but somehow I
can’t recall you.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not,” continued the other, with a
laugh. “Do you remember coming alongside a
tramp on Christmas Day ’17? You were in a
M.L. and you got some bully beef and bread out
of our old hooker. At the same time you warned
us that there were two U-boats off Bolt Head, and
said we’d better leg it back to Plymouth?”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant remembered the circumstance. It
was during the war, when he was in command of
a M.L.</p>

<p>“But I can’t recall your features,” he reiterated.</p>

<p>“ ’Cause I am beautifully disguised with a
beard,” explained the other. “Matter of fact, we
didn’t take your advice. We held on our
course, and bagged a Fritz a couple of hours
later. We were a ‘Q’ ship, and you didn’t
spot us.”</p>

<p>“Heard about it later on,” said Mr. Grant.
“Then your name’s Carter?”</p>

<p>“Just so; late Scoutmaster of the 9th Gosport
Sea Scouts. Unfortunately, ‘owing to the War,’
I had to give up, much to my regret, and settle
down here at Kingswear. Come aboard, and we
can yarn while I’m towing your craft out of the
harbour.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant accepted the invitation, leaving
Brandon actually in command of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>The tow-rope was made fast, the moorings
slipped. Very gently, by skilful use of the reverse
gear, Mr. Carter allowed the yacht to gather way
in the wake of the 4-h.p. motor boat.</p>

<p>During the run down the harbour, Brandon
kept all hands busily employed in casting loose
mainsail and mizzen and hoisting the jib in stops
ready to be broken out directly the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was
cast off. Thus engaged they failed to notice the
relatively slow progress or the somewhat unusual
swirl under the yacht’s stern. Nor were they
aware of the presence of a highly exasperated deck-hand
on board the <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span>, who consoled
himself for the preliminary failure of his plans by
the thought that perhaps the motor boat would not
tow the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> right out to sea, but only just clear
of St. Petrox. In that case there was still some
hope that the yacht would pile herself up upon the
tide-swept Verticals or perhaps the rugged Mewstone.</p>

<p>“You’ve a lump of a craft there, Grant,” remarked
Mr. Carter. “She’s heavier to tow than
I thought; although this packet is only a four-horse
motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Yet she’s moving her all right,” added Mr.
Grant.</p>

<p>“Yes, with the tide. I doubt whether we are
doing three knots. Has the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> compo. been
scrubbed recently?”</p>

<p>“Fresh on a week ago,” declared the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>“H’m,” commented Mr. Carter, “strange
we aren’t doing better. A few days ago I gave
a forty tonner a pluck in, and made quite easy
work of it once I got her going. There’s the
East Blackstone”—pointing to an isolated rock
about half a mile away. “I’ll tow you inside the
rock. There’s plenty of water and less tide
running. You’re early yet for the up-Channel
stream, but with the breeze you’ll stem the tide
all right.”</p>

<p>At the East Blackstone the tow-rope was cast
off. Mr. Grant regained the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, and the crew
gave a hearty cheer for the benefit of the ex-Scoutmaster.
Sail was quickly made, and under
all plain canvas the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was steadied on her
course for Portland Bill.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. The anchored motor boat
was still unaccountably near. The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, in
spite of the steady favourable breeze, was not
going anything like as fast as she had done in a
lighter wind.</p>

<p>The Sea Scouts began to realise the fact and
reluctantly they admitted that it was so. Even
the dinghy’s painter was slack, whereas in this
breeze the water ought to be foaming at her
bows.</p>

<p>“We are going slowly, sir,” remarked Craddock.</p>

<p>“That’s what Mr. Carter said,” replied the
Scoutmaster. “There’s no reason why we should
as far as I can see, unless we’ve fouled a few
lobster pots. Look over the bows and see.”</p>

<p>Peter went for’ard and “laid out” along the
bowsprit. He could see the yacht’s forefoot
showing clearly through the pale green water.</p>

<p>“All clear there, sir,” he reported.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how anything could foul her
rudder,” observed Mr. Grant. “The keel band
projects sufficiently to prevent that; however,
just look to make sure.”</p>

<p>Craddock did so.</p>

<p>“Why!” he exclaimed. “There’s something
dragging astern. I can’t make out what it is,
’cause the wake is bubbling so much. Pass me
the boat-hook, Talbot.”</p>

<p>Lying at full length on the stern deck, Peter
probed with the iron-shod boat-hook. Metal
rasped on metal, and on attempting to withdraw
the boat-hook the Sea Scout found that it was
hitched in a line of some sort.</p>

<p>“Bear a hand, some of you fellows!” he called
out breathlessly.</p>

<p>Talbot and Symington came to his assistance.
All three hauled and levered at the stout ash boat-hook
stave.</p>

<p>“Can’t get in another inch,” declared
Talbot.</p>

<p>“Sure you’re not foul of the rudder?” asked
Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>“No, sir, it’s astern of the rudder, whatever
it is.”</p>

<p>“Now, Brandon, you’re in charge,” said the
Scoutmaster. “Carry on and see what you
can do.”</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader began throwing off his
scanty clothing.</p>

<p>“Down helm!” he ordered. “Jib and staysail
sheets a-weather!”</p>

<p>It took three attempts to get the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> to come
up into the wind so that she might be hove-to.
As sluggish as a mule, she absolutely refused to
go about until Carline and Wilson got her round
by means of a sweep. Then Craddock prodded
with the boat-hook, and this time found nothing
more resisting than water.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is it has slipped off,” he announced.</p>

<p>“I’ll make sure, in any case,” declared
Brandon.</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader made a clean dive, broke
surface, and swam to the yacht’s stern. Then,
taking a deep breath, he grasped the edge of the
rudder and lowered himself towards the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span>
heel.</p>

<p>He was under for nearly half a minute; then
he reappeared, puffing and blowing like a grampus.</p>

<p>“There’s a large iron bucket hanging from the
lower pintle,” he reported. “I tried to shake it
clear, but it’s made fast by about a couple of yards
of wire rope.”</p>

<p>“See if you can work the free end of the wire
past the stern-post,” suggested Craddock. “I’ll
put the helm hard over and see if that frees it.”</p>

<p>“There is no free end,” was the astonishing
reply. “Both ends are tightly knotted round the
handle of the bucket.”</p>

<p>All hands realised that the obstruction had not
been placed there by accident or natural causes.
Human agency had been deliberately at work.</p>

<p>“No use arguing about it, lads!” called out
Brandon. “Pass me the hack-saw.”</p>

<p>“One minute, I’ll be with you, Frank,” said
Craddock, proceeding to strip. “It’s not much
use sawing at a slack wire. Get a line, Talbot.
That’s right. Now, Frank, can you pass this under
the handle of the bucket? You can? Good.
Now, you fellows, take a strain; put plenty of
beef into it and keep the rope taut.”</p>

<p>Craddock then went overboard and swam to
give his chum a hand. They found that the strain
on the rope had brought the bucket within five or
six inches of the surface, and that the wire was as
taut as a bar of iron.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be easier and quicker to saw
through the handle?” asked Craddock.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we won’t,” decided the Patrol Leader.
“Why spoil what seems to be a jolly decent
bucket?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve kicked the bucket,” declared Peter
feelingly.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter greeted this apparently
innocent remark. Craddock, failing to grasp the
grim significance of the words, couldn’t imagine
why his chums should roar because he had stubbed
his toe against the submerged article.</p>

<p>Taking turns to use the hack-saw, the two lads
set to work energetically. True they broke a
couple of blades—mishaps that, owing to the
erratic motion of the yacht and their unstable
position, were not to be wondered at—but at
length the tautened wire parted. The bucket was
hauled in deck while Brandon, who believed in
doing a good job thoroughly, extricated the
stranded wire rope from the narrow gap between
the rudder and the stern-post.</p>

<p>“Dirty dogs, whoever they are,” commented
the Patrol Leader, after he had hauled himself
clear of the water.</p>

<p>“Here’s a clue, anyway,” exclaimed Heavitree.</p>

<p>He pointed to the somewhat dented side of the
bucket. On it could be traced the partly obliterated
letters in black paint.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. UM .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. R.J.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.K.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Lumberjack!</span>” announced Craddock. “That’s
the name of the tramp lying next to us at Dartmouth.”</p>

<p>“Why should any of her crew want to play a
joke on us, I wonder?” enquired Carline.
“Couldn’t you write to the owners and find out
the names of the crew, sir? That might explain
matters.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking seriously of doing so,” replied
Mr. Grant. “There may be more in this business
than we know. It’s not merely a practical joke;
had we been compelled to tack out of harbour the
result might easily have been disastrous. Now,
Brandon! Get way on her again. She ought to
slip along in a nice breeze like this; and Portland’s
still a long way off.”</p>

<p>With that the Scoutmaster went below.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XII &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Out of Action</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>r. Grant</span> went to his cabin for a very
serious reason. His hand was rapidly
swelling. The slight cut he had received when
he rescued young Marner from the sinking
schooner had resulted in an undoubted case of
blood-poisoning. He, who was prone to boast of
his immunity from that sort of thing, had at last
fallen a victim to the dangerous malady.</p>

<p>For some time he had suspected it. He ought
to have gone ashore at Dartmouth and seen a
doctor. He would have done but for the fear that
he might be ordered to lay up. In that case, the
voyage of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> would have been indefinitely
prolonged—long after the forthcoming Jamboree
was over. Although Brandon was quite a capable
fellow, he held no warrant, without which Sea
Scouts are not permitted to go afloat; and it was
doubtful whether a fully qualified man could be
found to undertake the duties of temporary Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>So, rather than spoil the lads’ chance of taking
part in the Chichester Harbour Jamboree, Mr.
Grant risked his own.</p>

<p>He had had a restless night. Almost hourly he
had crept softly from his bunk lest he should disturb
the rest of the crew, and had held the injured
hand in very warm water. But all to no seeming
purpose. The middle finger was swelling badly,
and, what was ominous, sharp, stabbing pains
were running up his arm. Curiously, the cut at
the base of the fingers appeared to be healing,
while the swelling was most pronounced on the
knuckle of the same digit.</p>

<p>As he kept his hand in the hot water, Mr.
Grant’s thoughts turned to the incident of the
bucket. It seemed strange indeed that already
the maiden cruise of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> should be marked
by three distinct—or apparently distinct—attempts
to bring her to disaster. But were they distinct?
Could it be that Blueskin Bone was the instigator
of all three? Dick Marner’s innocent admission
that his father and Carlo Bone were more than
neighbours, coupled with the discovery that
Marner senior’s story of the motor bicycle was
a deliberate falsehood, tended to shake Mr.
Grant’s previous belief in Blueskin’s innocence in
the attempt at arson. Carlo Bone had gone to sea.
Was it beyond the bounds of coincidence that he
was one of the crew of the <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span>?</p>

<p>He went on thinking and thinking. Presently,
in a hazy sort of way, he became aware that his
thoughts were ridiculously disjointed and absurd.
The pain in his arm seemed to be subsiding, but
in its stead he felt uncomfortably hot. His head
was buzzing. Grey lights danced in front of his
eyes.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Grant did something he had never
done before in his life. He fainted.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Peter Craddock, who was
making his way to the fo’c’sle, found his Scoutmaster
lying inertly across the raised coaming of
his cabin doorway.</p>

<p>Checking his first impulse to alarm the rest of
the crew, Peter lifted the unconscious form and
carried it into the saloon. Here, with very little
effort, the Sea Scout lifted Mr. Grant on the
lee’ard settee; then, going to the companion way,
asked Heavitree in a matter-of-fact voice to step
below.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything to the other chaps,”
cautioned Peter, when his chum came below.
“Mr. Grant’s fainted. I found him lying in the
doorway. Get some sal volatile and a basin of
cold water while I loosen his collar.”</p>

<p>“What made him faint?” asked Heavitree, as
he carried out Craddock’s instructions.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” replied Peter. “It’s not concussion.”</p>

<p>“His finger, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Rot!” ejaculated the lad contemptuously.
Then he caught sight of the badly swollen hand.
“By Jove! Believe you’re right, old son. I knew
he had a nasty gash, but I never knew it was as
bad as this. Skylight’s open: you might open all
the scuttles. The more fresh air the better.”</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Grant opened his eyes and looked
dazedly at his youthful attendants.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, sir,” replied Peter reassuringly.
“Heavitree and I are looking after you.
Lie still a little longer.”</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster did so. The ghastly greyish
hue on his features was giving place to the glow
of returning vitality. His thoughts were again
becoming coherent, yet he felt a curious sense of
resentment at being ordered to remain quiet.</p>

<p>With returning consciousness came the agonising
throb of his swollen arm. His hand was
trailing over the side of the settee. It felt like
lead. He was hardly able to raise it.</p>

<p>“Silly of me to have gone off like that,” he
soliloquised. “Well, that’s put me out of the
running for a bit. Hang it all—no! What am I
thinking about?”</p>

<p>A vision of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> with her youthful crew
flashed across his mind. So far all was going well.
The sea was calm, the weather fine. Brandon
knew the course, but would he be able to take the
yacht into port?</p>

<p>“I’ll go on deck now,” he declared.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, sir,” countered Craddock
firmly. “You aren’t fit to go. Wait till we’ve
done something to that hand of yours. You’ll
only make it worse if you bang it against something.
I’ll dress it for you. Does it hurt much?”</p>

<p>“A little,” admitted Mr. Grant deprecatingly,
for the pain was now intense. Possibly in his fall
he had jarred the already badly swollen limb.</p>

<p>Peter went for’ard to boil some water and make
a bread poultice. While the water was being
heated he went on deck to tell Brandon and the
others of what had occurred.</p>

<p>He found Talbot at the helm. Symington and
Wilson were trying with varying success to induce
Molly to sit up and beg. The pup was willing
enough, but the gentle motion of the yacht was
too much for her. Also she had a not unfounded
suspicion that the cat rescued from the <span class='it'>Euterpe</span>—young
Marner had emphatically declined to take
it with him—was secretly helping herself to the
pup’s bowl of milk.</p>

<p>“Where’s Brandon?” asked Peter.</p>

<p>“Up aloft,” replied Talbot, glancing at the
cross-trees.</p>

<p>“I’ll be down in half a shake, old son!” called
out the Patrol Leader. “I’ve been trying to sight
Portland Bill. It’s too far off yet.”</p>

<p>Craddock swept the horizon. Right astern and
on the port quarter the red hills of Devon were
merging into the mist of a hot summer’s day.
Broad on the port beam, where the chalk cliffs
make their first appearance on the south shores of
England, land was no longer visible. Neither was
it ahead. To starboard, Peter knew, was the broad
expanse of the English Channel. For the first time
in his life, Craddock was about to find himself out
of sight of land. With the exception of Brandon,
the other Sea Scouts were to have a similar experience:
afloat with an unbroken horizon of sea
and sky forming a complete circle of which the
little <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> formed the exact centre. It was true
that they had been out of sight of land during the
fog, but that wasn’t the same thing. Had there
been no fog they would have seen the rugged
Cornish coast the whole time. Now, even in the
clearest weather, they would probably be an hour
or more out of sight of land until the wedge-shaped
promontory of Portland showed up on the
port bow.</p>

<p>Even as Craddock looked, a strange, muffled
voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Isn’t it quite about time you fellows liberated
me from this uncomfortable apartment?”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XIII &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Stowaway</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>or</span> a few moments, Peter Craddock could
hardly believe his sense of hearing. Wilson
and Symington were also too astonished for words.
They could only abandon their efforts to teach the
pup tricks and gaze blankly at Craddock’s face.
The first conclusion they arrived at was that Peter
was indulging in a little ventriloquism at their
expense.</p>

<p>Craddock, too, tried to “fix” the owner of the
voice. With the exception of Heavitree the others
were on deck. Carline was for’ard, lying in
luxurious ease and basking in the sunshine on the
fore-deck. Brandon was still aloft; Talbot at the
helm; Symington and Wilson in the cockpit.</p>

<p>“Kindly open the door!” exclaimed the voice
again. This time there was a violent rapping on
the panel of one of the side lockers in the cockpit.</p>

<p>The locker was a fairly spacious one, extending
from the after bulkhead of the cabin on the starboard
side to the bulkhead supporting the decked-in
part of the stern. Usually it contained spare
sails, canvas awnings, and warps not likely to be
frequently required. It was secured by means of
a detachable panel held in place by two projecting
battens at one end and a stout wooden button at
the other.</p>

<p>“Brandon!” sang out Peter.</p>

<p>“Coming,” replied the Patrol Leader. “What’s
wrong?”</p>

<p>Swinging himself down by the throat halliards,
Brandon gained the deck and came aft.</p>

<p>“Someone’s in there,” declared Craddock.</p>

<p>“Then hike him out,” rejoined Brandon in
matter-of-fact tones. “This isn’t the First of
April, me lad!”</p>

<p>“I quite agree,” boomed the voice from the
locker.</p>

<p>Brandon gave a start, but quickly recovering
himself, threw open the panel. Lying full length
on the assortment of canvas gear and blinking in
the strong sunlight was a boy of about twelve or
fourteen.</p>

<p>“Come out!” ordered Brandon sternly.</p>

<p>“Precisely what I’ve been wanting to do for the
last five minutes,” replied the youth, with astonishing
coolness. “Just wait until I have collected
my scanty belongings and your request will be
complied with.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never——” ejaculated the Patrol
Leader.</p>

<p>“Don’t distress yourself,” continued the boy.
“Wait until I am in a position to offer an explanation.
My limbs, I find, are somewhat
cramped.”</p>

<p>With the utmost deliberation the stowaway
emerged and stood upright in the cockpit with
the Sea Scouts still too astonished to say much,
hemming him in on three sides.</p>

<p>He was a pale-faced, sharp-featured lad of
medium height and sparely built. The most
noticeable feature about him was a high and
prominent forehead. He was dressed in a tightly
fitting suit of grey tweed and an Eton collar, his
thin, bony wrists projecting quite three inches
beyond his coat sleeves. Under one arm he held
a schoolboy’s satchel, from which protruded a
glass-stoppered bottle.</p>

<p>“You hid yourself on board?” began Brandon.</p>

<p>“Your surmise is a perfectly correct one,”
agreed this remarkable youth, with a grave smile.
“In the circumstances I had no option. Had I
asked to be allowed to accompany you, my request
would have been refused. As it is, I’m here.”</p>

<p>“A stowaway!” exclaimed the Patrol Leader.
“You deserve a booting.”</p>

<p>The boy made a deprecatory movement with
his hand.</p>

<p>“Believe me, it isn’t done,” he rejoined. “Personal
violence to stowaways is, I take it, an
obsolete practice that has shared the same fate as
walking the plank and keel-hauling. At least, I
hope I am not misinformed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I say, what a
jolly little pup!”</p>

<p>“Never mind the pup,” protested Brandon.
“Tell me what you are doing on board.”</p>

<p>“Enjoying—or expecting to enjoy—a free
journey to Chichester. The chances are I shall.
You can’t very well go back to Dartmouth; you
can’t put me overboard. So it seems as if I remain
here a while, and I’ve brought my provisions!”</p>

<p>“I’ll see what Mr. Grant has to say,” decided
Brandon, who had never before come in contact
with such a self-possessed and precocious
youngster.</p>

<p>“One minute,” interrupted Peter, drawing his
chum aside. “Come for’ard.”</p>

<p>Craddock and Brandon made their way to the
fore-deck, where Carline was slumbering in ignorance
of what had occurred.</p>

<p>“Mr. Grant fainted just now,” reported Peter.
“Heavitree’s with him. I fancy it’s his hand that
made him go off. It’s a case of blood-poisoning,
I’m afraid. I was boiling some water to make a
poultice when this happened. I vote we say
nothing to Mr. Grant until he’s had a good rest,
but I leave it to you. You’re skipper.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” agreed Brandon. “Where is he?
In his cabin?”</p>

<p>“No, on one of the settees in the saloon.”</p>

<p>“Then carry on, old son. I’ll tell the others
to keep clear a bit and not to disturb him. You
can manage all right?”</p>

<p>Peter went below. He found that the Scoutmaster
was nearly asleep and that the water was
boiling. It seemed an unpleasant duty to have to
rouse the patient, but it had to be done.</p>

<p>The poultice was made and applied. It was a
very hot one, and Mr. Grant winced; but in a
few minutes the warmth began to act soothingly
upon the fiercely throbbing finger.</p>

<p>“That’s ever so much better, Peter,” remarked
Mr. Grant gratefully.</p>

<p>“Good business, sir,” rejoined the Sea Scout.
“Now, try and go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Not much doubt about that,” said the patient.
“I’ll try a couple of hours’ sleep. Tell Brandon
to inform me when Portland Bill is in sight. It
ought to show up one point on our port bow.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>As he was leaving the cabin, Peter signed to
Heavitree.</p>

<p>“I’ll send Wilson down to relieve you,” he said.
“There’ll have to be someone in the saloon in
case Mr. Grant wants anything. Give an eye to
the kettle before you come on deck, and bring
some grub with you. We’ll have dinner on deck,
then we won’t disturb him.”</p>

<p>Peter found the stowaway still hemmed in by
the justifiably inquisitive Sea Scouts. The boy
had dropped much of his stiffness of manner and
seemed more at ease, although he retained his
quaint method of speech. Possibly he had been
nervous and had concealed his anxiety under a
mask of forced self-assurance. Now, finding that
the youthful crew of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were not in any
way antagonistic, he was becoming quite communicative.</p>

<p>His name, he told them, was Eric Little. He
made the statement somewhat doubtfully, fearing,
perhaps, that his audience would “pull his leg”
over that once well-known book: “Eric, or Little
by Little.” He had had quite enough of that
already. Fortunately his fears in that respect were
ill-founded, for the work in question had mercifully
not been brought to the notice of the
Aberstour Sea Scouts.</p>

<p>Eric’s parents were dead. He had been
“brought up” by his grandparents who lived on
the outskirts of Dartmouth. Apparently they had
weird and misguided notions as to how their
grandchild should be brought up. They had a
strange antipathy to schoolmasters. They absolutely
declined to let Eric go to school or to
associate with other children. His education, if
such it could be called, was imparted by a half-baked
governess of uncertain age and of a frigid
and ultra-prim manner. The natural result was
that Eric, invariably in the company of grown-ups,
had developed the pedantic manner of speech
that had so greatly astonished Brandon and his
companions. He was well versed in several serious
subjects, but his knowledge of the ways of boys of
his own age was lamentably weak. In spite of
himself, he was fast developing into a little prig,
and if compelled to run in the same rut he would
be an object of derision and scorn when the time
came for him to go out into the world.</p>

<p>Luckily for him, although he did not know it,
his uninvited presence on board the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was to
be the making of him.</p>

<p>He had no idea of running away from his overkind
and misguided grandparents. He merely
wanted a change. Somewhere in the neighbourhood
of Chichester he had an aunt and uncle. He
had never seen them, and beyond receiving presents
from them at Christmas and on his birthday
he was hardly aware of their existence. Yet he
felt a vague longing to visit them, and although
he had hinted of his wish in that direction, his
grandparents had for some unexplained reason
declined to allow him to do so.</p>

<p>Eric had exercised considerable intelligence in
making a bid for a free journey to Chichester.
Quite by chance he had been standing under the
Butterwalk when Craddock and Talbot were talking
with some members of a Dartmouth troop of
Scouts. He gathered that the two former were
going to Chichester Harbour in a yacht for the
Jamboree. What the word “Jamboree” meant
he knew not. It sounded like something jolly.
At any rate, opportunity was knocking at the door
of his warped little mind, and there and then he
made up his mind to stow himself away on board
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>Acting upon his grandfather’s oft-repeated precept
that “There is no time like the present,”
Eric got busy. He had a few shillings with him.
This he invested in a supply of food and a couple
of bottles of ginger-beer. He knew that all the
crew of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were ashore; Craddock had
mentioned that there were eight including a Scoutmaster,
and eight had certainly landed at the steps
close to the boat pond. For the sum of one
shilling a weedy youth minding a yacht’s dinghy
agreed to row him off to the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, and there he
hid himself in the locker, hoping that the yacht
would put to sea that evening—which she did not.</p>

<p>“What did you do with yourself all night?”
asked Brandon.</p>

<p>“Oh, when you were all asleep I emerged from
my place of concealment for fresh air and in order
to stretch my cramped limbs,” explained the
stowaway. “Once that pup of yours growled,
but I don’t think it was on my account. That was
when a certain person swam off to the yacht from
the large ship at anchor.”</p>

<p>“Someone swam off!” exclaimed Craddock.
“What did he do? Why didn’t you raise the
alarm?”</p>

<p>Eric turned reproachful eyes upon his questioner.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” he replied. “It couldn’t be
done! It couldn’t really. Consider my position.
I really had no right to be on board. Neither,
presumably, had the swimmer to climb up over
the side. After all’s said and done, it wasn’t my
affair, was it?”</p>

<p>“That was the chap who lashed the bucket to
the rudder,” declared the Patrol Leader. “What
sort of fellow was he?”</p>

<p>“I gathered that he did so from subsequent
happenings,” rejoined Eric. “Regarding your
question, I’m sorry to inform you that I had no
opportunity of studying his features. Nocturnal
conditions and a natural desire to efface myself
combined to keep me in ignorance of the man’s
appearance. But here I am,” he added briskly,
“willing to acquire as much nautical knowledge
as my mental appetite will digest. Which, by the
by, is the main brace?”</p>

<p>He cocked his eye aloft at the expanse of
tautened canvas, and then looked at Brandon
enquiringly.</p>

<p>“No use, my lad,” replied the Patrol Leader.
“You won’t find a brace aboard this craft. Sea
Scouts favour belts, you know. Now, lads!
Dinner! We’re behind time.”</p>

<p>The meal was duly relished and dispatched, the
stowaway receiving a share as a matter of course.
“Washing-up,” a distasteful yet necessary operation,
was completed, the plates and other utensils
being temporarily stowed in one of the cockpit
lockers in order that Mr. Grant would not be
disturbed had the gear been returned to its usual
place.</p>

<p>By this time the wind had fallen light and was
almost dead aft. Land was still visible; only an
expanse of smooth sea rippled by erratic catspaws
greeted the sight of the crew.</p>

<p>“Can’t we hoist the topsail?” asked Heavitree.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Brandon decidedly, “we can’t.
Scoutmaster’s orders are that the topsail is not to
be set without his permission. But we can hoist
the spinnaker,” he added. “That’ll help us
along.”</p>

<p>The spinnaker, a large triangular sail of light
canvas, was spread by being hoisted by a halliard
to the mainmast head, the tack being secured to
the mast below the gooseneck, while the third
corner of the sail was hauled out to the extremity
of a horizontal spar known as the spinnaker boom.
The latter was held by means of a sheet, but in
order to prevent any tendency on the part of the
boom to swing back, it was secured on the free
side of the sail by means of a rope called a “guy.”
The duty of “manning the guy” was deputed to
Fred Heavitree.</p>

<p>“All ready, there?” sung out Brandon.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” replied Craddock.</p>

<p>“Up with her, then! Out out-haul! Check
your sheet!” ordered the Patrol Leader.</p>

<p>Craddock and Talbot at the halliard whipped
the head of the canvas aloft. Simultaneously,
Wilson tailed on to the out-haul. The spinnaker,
distended by the light breeze, strained at the
sheet; then, without warning, dropped from aloft
in shivering folds. Unaccountably the halliard
had parted, letting the spinnaker down with a run.</p>

<p>There was a heavy splash. Heavitree, enveloped
by the canvas, had been jerked into the sea.</p>

<p>“Man overboard!” shouted Craddock. “Down
helm, Carline!”</p>

<p>The helmsman put the tiller hard over. Peter,
snatching up a life-buoy, prepared to throw it
within easy reach of the Sea Scout in the ditch.
The others, abandoning the spinnaker, rushed aft
to bring the dinghy alongside to pick up their
chum.</p>

<p>Alertly, Craddock watched the curving line of
ripples astern as the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> came up into the
line. There was no sign of Heavitree. The lad
was an excellent swimmer, but there was the likelihood
that he had hit the rail as he fell and had
been rendered insensible.</p>

<p>Full thirty long-drawn-out seconds passed, but
still no sign of Heavitree. Peter looked at Brandon.
The Patrol Leader shook his head.</p>

<p>He was outwardly cool and collected; yet the
disappearance of Heavitree without a trace filled
him with apprehension. Even a stunned man
under water would be expelling air from his lungs
and the bubbles would show on the surface. The
difficulty was that already the yacht had covered
fifty or more yards since the time the accident had
occurred, and in consequence it was futile to
attempt to dive after the lad. And yet it was
agonising having to stand and watch and yet do
nothing.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was now hove-to on to the port
tack, her head-sheets, which had not been eased,
being taut to wind’ard. The folds of the spinnaker
hung idly over the starboard side between
the shrouds and the forestay.</p>

<p>With one exception everyone was looking
astern. The exception was Eric Little. Unnoticed
by the others he crept cautiously for’ard
and began to gather in the trailing canvas. Hanging
on to the rail was the missing Heavitree,
breathless but otherwise none the worse for his
immersion. He had managed to grasp the coaming
as he fell, although he was immersed up to his
waist. The spinnaker, completely enveloping
him, had effectually hidden him from view.</p>

<p>Willing hands assisted Heavitree on deck. The
Sea Scouts relieved their pent-up feelings with a
rousing cheer, the noise of which brought Mr.
Grant hurriedly on deck.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, lads?” he demanded
anxiously, as he blinked in the strong sunlight.
Coming straight from the darkened saloon he could
see little or nothing. “Why are we hove-to?”</p>

<p>“I fell into the ditch, sir,” replied Heavitree.
“Or, nearly. How’s your hand, sir? Mind you
don’t hit it against anything.”</p>

<p>“Better go below, sir,” suggested Brandon.
“We haven’t sighted Portland Bill yet. I’ll report
to you when we do.”</p>

<p>There was a decided streak of obstinacy in Mr.
Grant’s nature and occasionally it asserted itself.
It did now.</p>

<p>He sat down, still blinking. By this time his
eyes were becoming more accustomed to the sunlight.
He noticed the untidily stowed spinnaker,
then he spotted Eric Little.</p>

<p>“Who’s that, Brandon?” he asked. “What
is that lad doing here? How did he come
aboard?”</p>

<p>“Our prize stowaway,” replied the Patrol
Leader.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XIV &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Peril of the Race</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>ate</span> in the afternoon the long-looked-for
Portland Bill was sighted—not on the port
bow, but dead ahead. Apparently in the light air
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had been carried by an indraught
slightly to the nor’ard of her proper course. Progress
had been slow, and in consequence she had
lost her tide and was now making very little
against the west-going stream.</p>

<p>“It will mean another night at sea, lads,” remarked
Mr. Grant, when the Patrol Leader had
reported land in sight. “It will be quite five
hours before we pick up a fair tide, and then,
unless the wind holds, we’ll have to be jolly
careful we aren’t swept into Portland Race.”</p>

<p>“Let me know the course, sir, and I’ll see she
keeps to it,” declared Brandon. “There’s no
need for you to do anything. How’s your hand
now, sir?”</p>

<p>“Better,” replied the Scoutmaster, although he
knew perfectly well that it was far from being
right. “I’ll turn out at sunset.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to, really, sir,” protested Brandon.
“Take it easy to-night. If anything unusual
occurs we’ll give you a call.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant capitulated. He was still feeling “a
bit shaky.” The finger, thanks to action of
numerous poultices, had swollen still more, but
there were no indications of the poison discharging
itself. In these circumstances, an accidental
knock or blow might easily undo all the
good that had been done by fomentation. In
addition, the Scoutmaster “had a temperature,”
although he kept this knowledge to himself,
hoping that in a few hours’ time it would return
to normal.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with our stowaway,
sir?” asked Brandon.</p>

<p>“Send him home from the first place we touch
at,” replied Mr. Grant. “It’s unfortunate we
cannot signal. His grandparents must be very
anxious about him; but we can send a wire from
Swanage.”</p>

<p>“He’s a queer sort of fellow, isn’t he?” remarked
Brandon.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s hardly his fault. It’s the way
he’s been brought up,” replied the Scoutmaster.
“He uses those somewhat high-brow expressions
quite naturally, because he’s lived in an atmosphere
in which they are spoken. After all, it’s
the same with everyone. A stable boy unconsciously
uses racing slang because he hears it all
around him. A sailor’s expressions are often
unintelligible to landsmen, although his messmates
haven’t the slightest difficulty in understanding
what he says. Often we were at a loss
to know what the Cornish fisherfolk were saying.
Eric Little’s case is much the same, only in a very
much smaller environment. Well, right-o, Brandon.
Carry on, if you will. See that all hands
get a decent meal, then pick your watch and let
the rest turn in.”</p>

<p>Alive to his responsibilities, Brandon went on
deck, ordered the spinnaker to be taken in, and
set the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> on her new course. He, too,
realised the dangers of being becalmed at night
in the vicinity of that dangerous expanse of turbulent
water known as Portland Race.</p>

<p>Night came on. The yacht, moving slowly
through the calm water, was steadily losing
ground. Although she was pointing seawards, the
strong tide was sweeping her back. The Bill
appeared to be receding, but there was no likelihood
of losing sight of the powerful high light on
that famous promontory. With the turn of the
tide the leeway would be quickly made up, but
there was the risk of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> being carried
through the Race before she could gain a sufficient
offing to pass it to the south’ard.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock Mr. Grant came on deck to look
round. It was a perfectly calm night and the
shoreward lights showed up distinctly.</p>

<p>“We’re still rather close in,” he remarked.
“Those are the lights of Lyme Regis, and more
to the east’ard are those of Bridport. I wish we
had had time to visit Bridport. It’s a picturesque
little place. There used to be a quaint expression:
‘Struck with a Bridport dagger.’ Does anyone
know what that means?”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments; but
before Mr. Grant could explain, Eric Little
replied:</p>

<p>“I believe I know: it is a colloquial expression
signifying that a person has been
hanged.”</p>

<p>“Quite right!” exclaimed Mr. Grant approvingly.
“Bridport was noted for rope-making, and
also for sailcloth. Now I’ll tell you something
more, and I wonder if you can explain the reason
for it. Years ago when the rope and sailcloth
industry was at its height most of the flax was
brought to Bridport in Russian vessels. They
used to send the stuff up to the town in boats.
On Saturday nights the Russians made a point of
going into the town, which is some distance from
the harbour. The road between the two places
was lighted with oil lamps. Every time the
Russians returned to their ships these lamps
were afterwards found to be extinguished.
Why?”</p>

<p>Several suggestions were forthcoming, but at
each of them Mr. Grant shook his head.</p>

<p>“The Russian sailors drank the oil,” he explained.
“In those days the lamps were filled
with whale-oil, and that was evidently a liquid
appreciated by the Muscovites.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now, Brandon,
send the watch below down. I’ll turn in, since
the skipper insists; but call me at once, if
necessary. Good night!”</p>

<p>Retaining Heavitree as a deck-hand, Brandon
prepared for his long vigil. The wind showed no
indication of appearing. The sea was as smooth
as glass, save for the occasional ripples caused by
a fish “breaking surface.” For the next two hours
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was left to her own devices, drifting
idly, with the dinghy frequently ranging up alongside
as she swung through all the points of the
compass.</p>

<p>At midnight a faint haze obscured the bright
light of Portland, which was now about twelve
miles away. Before the light disappeared, Brandon
took a compass-bearing and noted it in the log.
Then he resumed his tedious watch.</p>

<p>“Four bells!” he announced at length, stirring
the torpid Heavitree with his foot. “You turn
in, now, old son, and tell Peter to come on
watch.”</p>

<p>“Where are we?” asked Craddock, as he
gained the cockpit.</p>

<p>Brandon told him, adding the information that
the flood tide had now set in.</p>

<p>“Haven’t touched the tiller for the last four
hours,” he remarked. “We’re just drifting. This
is where a motor would come in handy. Well,
thank goodness, this isn’t the Doldrums, and we
ought to get a breeze soon.”</p>

<p>At length came that “darkest hour before the
dawn,” when human vitality is supposed to be at
its lowest ebb. Through the stillness of the night
came a low rumble.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Peter. “Thunder?”</p>

<p>“Don’t think so,” replied his chum. “It’s too
prolonged.”</p>

<p>They listened. The sound continued and
seemed to increase in volume until it reached a
distinct rumbling roar.</p>

<p>“It must be the Race,” declared Brandon.
“Of course it’s still a long way off, but we’re
being carried into it.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” asked Peter.
“Anchor?”</p>

<p>“No use attempting to anchor in over twenty
fathoms,” replied the Patrol Leader. “Let’s get
the sweeps to work. It will be something to do,
and we may get her well clear with an hour’s
steady work. Gently with them; don’t disturb
the other fellows.”</p>

<p>Carefully the long ash sweeps were placed
in the rowlocks, and by means of steady strokes
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was brought round until the yacht’s
bows pointed sou’-sou’-east. The dinghy’s
painter no longer trailed in the water as the
little boat followed sedately in the wake of her
parent.</p>

<p>Again the beams of the high light of Portland
pierced the darkness, this time broad on
the port beam. The roar of the Race steadily
increased.</p>

<p>“Don’t think we’ll clear it,” muttered Brandon
breathlessly, for sweeping the yacht was heavy and
tiring work.</p>

<p>“I wish it were day,” rejoined Peter. “Then
we could see where we are. How far are we from
the Race, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Quite near enough,” admitted the Patrol
Leader. “You’d better inform Mr. Grant and
turn out a couple of hands to man the dinghy.
We might be able to tow the yacht as well as
sweep her.”</p>

<p>Craddock found the Scoutmaster awake. In
fact, Mr. Grant had hardly slept at all. Apart
from the still painful state of his arm his anxiety
as to what might happen on the turn of the tide
had kept him awake. He realised the danger. All
along that dangerous coast there is no harbour for
which a vessel can make for shelter except at or
about the time of high water. True, there is a
smooth passage between the Race and the Bill,
but even then a stranger is apt to get into difficulties
and be swept into the dangerous overfalls
unless he times the attempt at a favourable state
of the tide.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant came on deck.</p>

<p>“You’ve done all you can, Brandon,” he remarked.
“We may be able to tow her clear. Get
the other fellows out and see that the forehatch
and skylights are well secured. We’ll be having
plenty of green water over our decks before very
long, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Craddock was about to haul the dinghy
alongside, when he caught sight of the steaming-lights
of a vessel on the starboard quarter.
She was, he judged, about a quarter of a mile
away and heading straight for the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.
Above the distant roar of the Race could be distinguished
the steady pulsations of a marine
motor.</p>

<p>“Show a stern light,” ordered Brandon. “She
won’t be able to see our starboard light.”</p>

<p>Talbot produced a torch and held it pointing
in the direction of the oncoming vessel. Suddenly
a succession of “E’s” in Morse flashed from the
stranger; then, after a brief pause, came the
question, “What ship is that?”</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Kestrel!</span>” signalled Talbot in reply.</p>

<p>“I hope they’ll be the wiser for that,” remarked
Carline.</p>

<p>Then, to the astonishment of all on board, the
approaching craft announced her identity as the
<span class='it'>Merlin</span>, and followed up by asking whether the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> wanted a tow.</p>

<p>“Yes, badly,” was the reply.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the Falmouth Sea Scouts’
yacht was alongside.</p>

<p>“So we’ve overhauled you,” remarked Scoutmaster
Pendennis. “We wondered what had
happened. What made you put to sea in a
fog?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get our wire?” countered Mr.
Grant. “But explanations can come later. You’ve
arrived at a very opportune moment.”</p>

<p>“And how’s that?” asked Mr. Pendennis.</p>

<p>“We’re in danger of being swept through Portland
Race, and it looks as if you are heading
straight for it.”</p>

<p>“Are we, by Jove!” ejaculated the Cornishman.
“Yes, I can hear the roar now. Our engine
muffled the sound. Right-o! pass your line.
Course, sou’east?”</p>

<p>“Sou’-sou’-east would be better,” remarked
Mr. Grant. “ ’Tany rate, day’s breaking, and
we’ll soon see if we’re giving the Race sufficient
berth.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” rejoined Scoutmaster Pendennis.
“We’ll do our best, but we’ve only an eight horsepower
engine.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Merlin</span> forged slowly ahead until she took
up the strain of the tow; then, increasing power,
she whisked the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> along at a steady five
knots.</p>

<p>“You fellows can turn in again,” said Brandon,
addressing the Sea Scouts who had been routed
out of their bunks.</p>

<p>But the lads showed no desire to go below. In
the pale grey dawn they remained on deck,
dividing their interest between the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> and a
broad belt of white-foamed water barely a couple
of miles on the port hand. Although the sea
everywhere else was calm, the Race was one
chaotic mass of broken water, roaring like a wild
beast baulked of its prey.</p>

<p>“Good old <span class='it'>Merlin</span>!” exclaimed Talbot. “She’s
done the trick!”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant did not join in the chorus of appreciation.
It was yet too soon to shout. He had his
doubts on the ability of the little motor to carry
out its heavy task; for, although both yachts were
moving in a southerly direction at about five knots,
the now strong flood tide was setting in a nor’-easterly
direction at a good seven miles an hour.
The question that arose was whether the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>
and her tow could draw clear of the Race in time;
although there was some consolation in the fact
that the yachts were no longer in danger of being
carried into the centre of that tempestuous waste
of water.</p>

<p>Almost imperceptibly the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> began to feel
the influence of the broken waves. Soon she began
to pitch and roll. So did the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>, to the accompaniment
of a series of heavy jerks on the towing
hawser.</p>

<p>“Why, the Race is coming towards us!” remarked
Symington.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” rejoined Brandon drily. “We’re
going towards it. Hang on to something solid,
you fellows. We’ll be getting wet shirts in a
brace of shakes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You all right, sir? Mind
that arm!”</p>

<p>The fellows on the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> had by this time
noticed the danger that threatened them. Two
of her crew hurriedly paid out more hawser,
an act that at first looked as if the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> was
about to cast off her well-nigh helpless consort.
Some of the former’s crew who had been sitting
comfortably on the fore-deck came aft hurriedly
when they saw the wall of breaking water
approaching.</p>

<p>A minute later and both yachts were in the thick
of it. True, it was but the tail end of the dreaded
Race, but the sight of the agitated mass of water
was none the less awesome. At one moment the
<span class='it'>Merlin</span> was towing the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> through a calm
sea; at the next both craft, pitching, heeling, and
staggering, were being assailed by the furious
waves.</p>

<p>Again and again the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> dipped her bowsprit,
flung her bows high as her stern dropped
into the trough of the sea. Spars and solid gear
rattled, canvas shook and flapped furiously as
boom and gaff, bringing up with disconcerting
jerks, threatened to shake the mast out of her, the
while the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>, similarly assailed, was doing her
best to win through. Suddenly a particularly
vicious breaker surged over her quarter. The
motor stopped. Both yachts were now helpless in
the grip of the dreaded overfalls.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XV &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>“To be Returned in Due Course”</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> situation was desperate. The <span class='it'>Merlin</span>
was now a source of peril to the yacht she
had done her best to aid. There was no wind.
The fiercely flapping canvas was useless; equally
out of the question was it to attempt to make use
of the oars, for at one moment the blades would
be high in the air, at another buried by the rush
of the irregular and foaming waves. Held by the
towing hawser, the two yachts were in momentary
danger of colliding as they swung round almost
parallel to each other and with less than five yards
of chaotic water between them.</p>

<p>In a trice, Brandon realised the danger, made
up his mind, and acted. At the imminent risk of
being either jerked or washed overboard he fought
his way for’ard, hanging on desperately as he
battled towards his goal. One moment thigh deep
in water; at another sprawling on the ridge
formed by the steeply heeling cabin-top, he progressed
foot by foot. With bleeding knees and
broken finger-nails, well-nigh breathless with his
struggle, the Patrol Leader contrived to throw
himself flat upon the heaving fore-deck. Then,
hanging on with his left hand, he succeeded in
casting off the rope that held the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> to the
<span class='it'>Merlin</span>.</p>

<p>Then, obtaining a grip with both hands,
Brandon waited to witness the fruits of his
hazardous task. At first it seemed as if the act
were in vain. The two craft showed no tendency
to drift apart; on the contrary, it looked as if they
would close. Had they done so, the fate of each
would have been sealed, for the strongest yacht
ever built would not be proof against the terrific
hammering of the two hulls in that tumultuous
sea.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of anxious suspense, the
distance between the two vessels began to increase.
The <span class='it'>Merlin</span> swung round until her bows
pointed in the opposite direction to her previous
course. As she rolled, the crew of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
could see the Cornish Sea Scouts struggling
desperately in a futile attempt to restart the motor.</p>

<p>For another five minutes the ordeal continued;
then, almost as suddenly as she had entered the
Race, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> found herself in comparatively
calm water, with the final unwelcome gift of about
fifty gallons of the English Channel being thrown
in her cockpit.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Merlin</span> was not long in following her consort’s
example, and, with the roar of the turbulent
overfalls still dinning in their ears, the crews of
both yachts set about repairing the damage done
during their exciting quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that they had missed the most
dangerous part of Portland Race both craft had
come off comparatively lightly. Twenty minutes’
hard work at the pump freed the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> of the
water that had found its way on board. Her
mizzen-boom had been sprung close to the gooseneck;
one of the panes of the skylight had been
broken; while—worst of all—her dinghy’s top-strake
had been badly smashed owing to the boat
being thrown violently against the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span>
quarter.</p>

<p>Three of the Sea Scouts had received minor
injuries owing to the severe and erratic motion of
the yacht; Eric Little was “down and out” with
sea-sickness; while Molly, the pup, who had been
locked in the saloon, was nearly frantic with joy
when Peter went below to see how she had fared.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with your engine?” enquired
Mr. Grant, hailing the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>.</p>

<p>“Water on plug and in the carburetter,” replied
Scoutmaster Pendennis. “We’ll get her going
soon, I hope. I’ve heard a lot about Portland
Race, but I never expected it to be like that on a
calm day. Hello! what’s the matter with your
hand?”</p>

<p>“Poisoned it,” explained Mr. Grant. “It’s
getting better now. I say: what do you propose
to do?”</p>

<p>“We’re carrying on,” replied Pendennis. “We
want to make Yarmouth or Lymington to-day.
We’ll tow you until a breeze springs up.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to put into Swanage,” announced
Mr. Grant. “We’ve a stowaway on board and
we want to land him.”</p>

<p>“How interesting,” rejoined the Cornishman.
“All right, Swanage it is for both of us.
We want more petrol, although we may have
enough to carry us on if the breeze does show
up.”</p>

<p>Both yachts, now being propelled by sweeps,
were now standing up Channel at a distance of
about ten yards between them, so that the crews
could keep up a running fire of conversation. The
while the Cornish Sea Scouts were tackling the
still refractory motor.</p>

<p>It was not until the two craft had practically
drifted two miles to the east’ard of the Shambles
Lightship that the long-hoped-for breeze sprang
up—a steady sou’westerly one.</p>

<p>In grand style the two yachts cut through the
water, heading for the still distant St. Alban’s
Head. In point of speed there was little to choose,
for although the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> had a slightly greater displacement
and carried more canvas, this advantage
was countered by the drag of her now inactive
propeller.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go through another race, lads,”
observed Mr. Grant at breakfast. “That’s the
one off St. Alban’s, but it won’t be anything like
the one off Portland.”</p>

<p>“What causes them, sir?” asked Carline.</p>

<p>“It’s a sort of submarine steeplechase,” explained
the Scoutmaster. “A strong tidal water
sweeping over a fairly deep and level bed of the
sea suddenly encounters a submerged ledge of
rocks. The whole of that mass of water has to
find its way across in less than half the previous
depth, and since the level of the water cannot be
materially increased, the result is that the rate of
the flow of water has to be greatly increased and
causes a succession of overfalls.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, Eric:
feeling better? Good! Make a decent meal, my
lad, ’cause you’ve a long journey in front of you.”</p>

<p>“Is it very much further to Chichester?”
asked the youth.</p>

<p>“We’re sending you home to Dartmouth.”</p>

<p>“I think you are labouring under a misapprehension,
sir,” rejoined the precocious youth.
“I’m on my way to visit my aunt and uncle at
Chichester—and I won’t go back to Dartmouth!
If you won’t take me, I’ll walk the rest of the
way.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” remarked the Scoutmaster oracularly,
and changed the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>An hour later the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> and the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>
rounded St. Alban’s Head, where, with the exception
of a sullen swell, there was little to
indicate the locality of the ofttimes dangerous
Race. Followed a run along the rocky coast in
full view of the famous caves where smugglers
and wreckers once plied their infamous trade.
Durlstone Head was left astern and a course
shaped to clear the dangerous Peveril Ledge.
Then the whole expanse of Swanage Bay opened
into view.</p>

<p>Both yachts anchored in less than seven feet of
water just inside the shelter of Swanage Pier. The
Cornish lads went ashore in their quest for petrol
and provisions, and with them went the Sea Scouts
of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> with the exception of Craddock,
who, with Mr. Grant and the stowaway, remained
on board.</p>

<p>Brandon was the bearer of a telegraph form on
which Mr. Grant had written: “Have found a
stray grandson; please wire instructions.”</p>

<p>Having dispatched the wire, the Patrol Leader
and Heavitree made their way towards Peveril
Point in order to give Molly a run on a closely
cropped turf.</p>

<p>Waiting until a reply might be forthcoming,
Brandon called at the post-office. There was no
answer. After another half-hour had elapsed he
called again, still without success. From the
beach he semaphored the news to Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>The delay was getting serious. The <span class='it'>Merlin</span> was
ready to resume her voyage. There was a fair
wind and tide, but if the start were delayed much
longer a strong adverse tide would be encountered
in the Needles channel, which meant that perhaps
the Sea Scouts would be compelled to spend
another anxious night afloat.</p>

<p>“You’d better push on, Pendennis,” suggested
Mr. Grant. “We’ll follow and pick you up at
Lymington.”</p>

<p>The Cornishman fell in with the idea. As a
matter of fact, he particularly wanted to give his
crew a good night’s rest in some sheltered harbour
within The Wight; and, having the West of
England yachtsman’s typical respect for the mudbanks
and erratic tides of the Solent, he did not
relish the possibility of having to navigate that
intricate waterway in the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>So the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> “carried on.”</p>

<p>Craddock then semaphored a message to his
chum telling him to remain ashore until one
o’clock, but to keep the other Sea Scouts together
in case they had to re-embark in a hurry.</p>

<p>It was not until five minutes to the hour that
the expected telegram arrived. It read:</p>

<p>“Administer suitable chastisement. Return
delinquent at your convenience.”</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster made a wry face when the
telegram was handed him.</p>

<p>“That merely confirms my opinion, Brandon,”
he remarked in a low voice. “The lad’s grandfather
is not only very precise in his mannerisms;
he is evidently a bit of a martinet. I’ll say this for
Eric: he might be a queer little chap, but he’s
not a sneak. It was only by quite an accident that
I found out that he has been frequently thrashed
for minor offences. ‘Spare the rod and spoil the
child’ might be all very well if carried out with
fairness and moderation—although I very much
doubt the wisdom of personal chastisement, except
under very special circumstances. However, since
Mr. Little gives me a tolerably free hand, I’ll return
the delinquent at my convenience. That is:
we’ll take him along with us, and hand him over
to his uncle at Chichester.”</p>

<p>“That’s a topping idea, sir!” exclaimed the
Patrol Leader. “We’ll do our best to give the
lad a good time.”</p>

<p>“Then tell Eric the news,” continued Mr.
Grant. “Or, better, send him down to me. Get
under way as sharp as you can, Brandon. The
<span class='it'>Merlin</span> has a good start, but with luck we ought
to rejoin her before sunset.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XVI &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> to the Rescue</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he Sea Scouts</span> needed no second bidding to
get under way. The remote possibility of
being able to overhaul the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> acted as a spur.
By this time each lad knew his particular duty,
and in very quick time main and mizzen sails were
set, head-sails hoisted in stops, and the cable hove
short.</p>

<p>Then, at the Patrol Leader’s word of command,
the anchor was weighed and stowed in its
customary place, the jib and staysail were broken
out and trimmed to catch the favouring breeze,
and within five minutes from the order to get
under way the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was heading for the distant
Solent.</p>

<p>Already the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> was hull-down, only her
canvas showing above the skyline. She was
roughly eight miles ahead.</p>

<p>Outside Swanage Bay the wind freshened,
coming offshore in irregular gusts that swept over
the lofty chalk cliffs of Ballard Down. The tide
was still running to the east’ard with considerable
strength, but there was very little sea to speak of.
Even a sailing dinghy could be out without any
danger of shipping water.</p>

<p>Presently a craft under sail and motor overtook
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>. It was a flat-bottomed contraption
measuring, perhaps, twenty feet in length, and was
propelled by an outboard motor.</p>

<p>Brandon regarded the boat critically. It certainly
looked a freak. Apparently the designer
had originally intended to give her plenty of beam
and a broad transom; but, changing his mind,
had tapered the stern until it was about nine inches
in width. Consequently, and owing to the weight
of the heavy engine clamped on the stern, the boat
had very little bearing surface aft and a small
amount of freeboard.</p>

<p>In the stern-sheets sat a fat-faced, smug-looking
individual rigged out in a peaked cap and
blue reefer coat with brass buttons. His profile
reminded Brandon of a parrot, for his nose was
inclined to be hooked, while from underneath a
pair of full lips an insignificant receding chin
heightened the resemblance to a bird. The rest
of the “crew” consisted of three women and two
children. The sheet of the lugsail, Brandon
noticed, was made fast.</p>

<p>As this freakish craft overhauled the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>,
passing her at a distance of about twenty yards to
wind’ard, the brass-buttoned helmsman favoured
the Sea Scouts with a superior sort of smile.</p>

<p>“What a comic outfit!” exclaimed Craddock
to his chum. “That chap evidently thinks he’s
the goods.”</p>

<p>“He’s certainly pleased with himself at having
overhauled us,” rejoined the Patrol Leader. “But
wait a bit. There’s a patch of broken water ahead.
Let’s see how that old orange-box will take it.”</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Grant came on deck. He had
been writing in the cabin, and on hearing the
noise of the motor had glanced through the scuttle.
He, too, had not failed to notice the supercilious
grin on the fellow’s flabby features.</p>

<p>“That man’s looking for trouble,” he observed.
“There ought to be a ‘Society for the Protection
of Guests of Half-Baked Amateur Marine Motorists.’
Up helm a little Peter; keep in his wake.
Unless I’m much mistaken, that freak craft will
be in difficulties before very long.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was now about four hundred yards
to the sou’west of Old Harry, that well-known
chalk pinnacle forming the eastern extremity of
the Isle of Purbeck. The motor boat was by this
time a couple of hundred yards ahead and making
straight for a well-defined tide-rip caused by the
tidal current flowing over a ledge of submerged
rock running out from Standfast Point.</p>

<p>The greenhorn at the helm of the motor boat
failed to notice the popple of disturbed water.
His attention seemed to be centred upon the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, as if he were still gloating over his superior
speed.</p>

<p>Soon the boat began to pound heavily. Her
narrow stern dipped. Spray flew over the engine,
putting it out of action. The metal rudder was
totally inadequate to keep the flat-bottomed craft
on its course. A puff of wind filled the sail,
causing the boat to pay off and heel.</p>

<p>Too late the brass-buttoned novice realised the
danger. When he did, he could do nothing beyond
attempting to restart the engine. His weight
as he leant over the narrow stern made matters
worse. A sea poured completely over the weather
quarter. The boat still lived although half full of
water.</p>

<p>Panic seized the man. He had lost his yachting
cap—it was floating on the water that swirled over
the bottom-boards—and abject fear was plainly
written on his face, while his long hair streamed
in the breeze.</p>

<p>The while the sail was taking the full force of
the wind, for no attempt had been made to free
the sheet.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the boat shipped more water, the
mast became unshipped and disappeared over the
side, taking the sail with it. The boat, no longer
making way, fell into the trough of the sea and
took in water on both sides.</p>

<p>“Cut away your gear and ride to it!” shouted
Brandon, for the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was now within hailing
distance.</p>

<p>The advice, intelligible to anyone acquainted
with even an elementary knowledge of seamanship,
was lost as far as the bewildered and panic-stricken
owner of the motor boat was concerned.
He could only wave his arms wildly and shout for
help. The women, although obviously badly
scared, at least had the sense to keep still.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster glanced at Brandon and
nodded. The Patrol Leader understood. It was
a silent intimation that he was to exercise his discretion
in the operation of bringing the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
alongside the fast-foundering boat.</p>

<p>“Stand by to go about!” ordered Brandon.</p>

<p>Two of the Sea Scouts jumped to tend the head-sheets.
Heavitree, boat-hook in hand, took up his
station at the main-shrouds. Craddock was at the
tiller. The others stood by ready to help the
“crew” of the motor boat into safety.</p>

<p>“Up helm a bit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at that!” exclaimed
Brandon.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, with the wind well abaft the beam,
flew past the now almost waterlogged boat. Mistaking
the nature of the manœuvre, the brass-buttoned
man waved his arms in redoubled
frenzy and literally howled when he thought the
ketch was leaving him to his fate.</p>

<p>Brandon knew quite well what he was doing.
To attempt to bring the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> alongside with a
quartering wind would result in the boat being
crushed, or at least it would have been impossible
to get a hold and retain it. There was only one
course practicable, and that was to run to lee’ard,
go about, and shoot up into the wind, losing way
within a few feet of the object for succour.</p>

<p>“Lee-o!” exclaimed Brandon, loudly and
clearly.</p>

<p>Peter put the helm down. Talbot and Symington
let fly the jib and foresail sheets; while Wilson
hauled away at the slack of the mainsheet. Still
keeping the tiller hard over, Craddock attended
to the mizzen-sheet.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> came about as gracefully as her
namesake, turning slowly and unfalteringly. Then,
kept down in the eye of the wind, she forged ahead
with gradually diminishing way until Heavitree
could grip the gunwale of the motor boat with
the boat-hook.</p>

<p>By this time the boat had been swamped. Her
stern, weighted down by the outboard engine, was
six feet beneath the surface, while the bows, kept
afloat by the air under the fore-deck, were about
a couple of feet above water. To the still floating
portion the “crew” clung, while the owner, his
face green with terror, abandoned his waterlogged
craft and made a jump for the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> shrouds.
Forgetting the difficulties of “taking off” from
a submerged platform, he leapt short but continued
to grip the rail. There he hung, submerged
to his shoulders, puffing like a grampus as he
struggled in vain to haul himself on board the yacht.</p>

<p>The sight of the selfish, cowardly man made
Mr. Grant lose his temper—a thing he rarely did.
He realised that with the fellow’s bulk between
the yacht’s side and the sinking motor boat the
difficulty of getting the rest of the party on board
was enormously increased. Time, too, was
precious, for the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> would soon “pay off”
and gather way, in which case the manœuvre of
getting alongside the waterlogged craft would
have to be repeated.</p>

<p>“Let go, you idiot!” roared the Scoutmaster.
“Haven’t you heard of ‘women and children
first’?”</p>

<p>The man refused to do so.</p>

<p>“Stamp on his fingers, Heavitree!” exclaimed
Mr. Grant, realising that if a calamity likely to
become a fatality were to be avoided, drastic
measures were absolutely imperative.</p>

<p>Heavitree was unable to carry out these instructions.
All his efforts were concentrated upon an
attempt to retain a hold on the boat and to prevent
it sinking still further as the women strove to raise
themselves out of the water.</p>

<p>Just then the partly submerged boat surged
against the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> side. The craven owner’s
generous proportions acted as an animated fender,
but the shock well-nigh winded him and caused
him to relax his grip.</p>

<p>In a trice Talbot grasped him by his long hair
and dragged him aft, where Craddock assisted in
hauling the man on deck.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Brandon and Symington set to work
like Trojans to tranship the badly scared women
and children. They were not a moment too soon.
The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was forging ahead.</p>

<p>“I can’t hold her much longer, sir!” exclaimed
Heavitree.</p>

<p>“Let her go,” replied Mr. Grant briefly.</p>

<p>Heavitree disengaged the boat-hook. The
swamped motor boat drifted astern. Bubbles of
air were escaping from the uptilted fore-deck.</p>

<p>“Shall we have a shot at salving her?” asked
Brandon.</p>

<p>The Scoutmaster shook his head.</p>

<p>“Let her go,” he replied. “She won’t have
another chance to drown anyone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There she
goes! Bon voyage!”</p>

<p>The freak craft disappeared from view. Mr.
Grant glanced dispassionately at the late owner,
who was still in an abject state.</p>

<p>“The yellow streak has shown itself, I notice,”
remarked the Scoutmaster. “Well, it’s no use
asking <span class='it'>him</span> questions. We’ll have to land the crew
somewhere. I wonder where they came from?”</p>

<p>“Where shall we make for, sir?” asked
Brandon.</p>

<p>“Studland,” replied Mr. Grant. “It’s just
round the corner. Give that point a wide berth.”</p>

<p>With a fair tide and beam wind, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
opened into the wide expanse of Studland Bay.
It would have meant a tedious beat shorewards
owing to the cliffs blanketing the wind, but fortunately
a motor passenger-boat happened to be
leaving the shore, and in response to a semaphored
message she ran alongside the yacht.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the still considerably scared
survivors of the sunken boat were transhipped to
the passenger craft, and the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, running before
the wind, resumed her attempt to overhaul
the far-distant <span class='it'>Merlin</span>.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Grant had recovered his
customary even temper.</p>

<p>“After all, perhaps the silly ass couldn’t help
being in a fearful funk,” he remarked. “When
all’s said and done, bravery largely consists of
being afraid of being afraid.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What’s that,
Wilson? They’ve made the saloon slopping wet?
Well, mop it up. That’ll be another Good Turn
to your credit.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>ith</span> all sail set, even the topsail and
spinnaker, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> tore through the
water, shaping a course to pass one mile to the
south’ard of Hengistbury Head, a bold promontory
situated roughly midway between Old Harry
and the Needles.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Merlin</span> was no longer in sight. In vain
Brandon, with a pair of binoculars, swung round
his neck, went aloft, where, perched on the cross-trees,
he brought his glasses to bear upon a limited
expanse of horizon that showed between the
straining canvas. He could see the brown sails
of half a dozen fishing boats and the smoke of a
steamer, but of the Cornish Sea Scouts’ craft not
a sign.</p>

<p>“They’ve too good a pair of heels for us,” he
remarked, when he regained the deck.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Heavitree, pointing
slightly on the starboard bow. “There’s something
white. Isn’t that the <span class='it'>Merlin’s</span> sails?”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right,” said Carline. “Only
she’s a long way out. Let me have the glasses,
Brandon.”</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader handed over the binoculars.
Carline levelled them at the supposed cloud of
canvas.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a white cliff rising out of the sea,”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Isle of Wight,” explained Brandon.
“It puzzled me at first. From the cross-trees I
could make out the Needles. If——”</p>

<p>A dull thud that shook the yacht from truck to
keel interrupted the Patrol Leader’s words. For
a brief instant the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> seemed to stop dead.
It might have been only an illusion, but everyone
on deck thought so.</p>

<p>“We’re aground!” exclaimed Talbot.</p>

<p>Brandon glanced over the side. The yacht was
still carrying way and lifting easily to the waves.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty of water everywhere,” he replied.
“We must have struck something, though.”</p>

<p>The jar brought Mr. Grant on deck to see what
was amiss.</p>

<p>“We struck something pretty heavy,” he remarked.
“Nip below, Peter, and look under the
floorboards in the fo’c’sle. She may have strained
a plank.”</p>

<p>Craddock did so. He had not been gone more
than a few seconds when the reason of the alarm
became evident. About a hundred yards on the
starboard quarter an enormous porpoise broke
surface, followed by another. Both animals were
badly scared, for they promptly dived and were
not seen again.</p>

<p>Presently Peter returned with the information
that the yacht was as tight as a bottle. Thanks
to her heavy build she had escaped damage,
although a vessel with slighter scantlings might
easily have had her bow planking stove in.</p>

<p>At length Hengistbury Head was brought
abeam, and for ten minutes the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had a
pretty stiff hammering over Christchurch Ledge.
By this time the Needles and the multi-coloured
cliffs of Alum Bay were clearly discernible, while
right ahead rose the slender tower of Hurst Castle
lighthouse.</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed Talbot. “Isn’t that the
<span class='it'>Merlin</span>?”</p>

<p>He pointed to a yacht about three miles dead
ahead. Brandon brought the binoculars into
action.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right, Talbot,” he replied. “It
is the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>. She’s becalmed.”</p>

<p>“Then, we may overhaul her yet,” said Wilson.</p>

<p>“She’ll use her motor,” declared Craddock.</p>

<p>“If they can get the thing to go,” added
Brandon. “But it’s rather strange. Here we are
busting along with every stitch of canvas drawing,
and they haven’t a breath of wind. The sea’s as
smooth as glass a mile ahead.”</p>

<p>As far as the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was concerned the breeze
held strong and true until she drew within a
hundred yards of the Cornish Sea Scouts’ craft.
Then the wind failed utterly. In the grip of the
now adverse tide both yachts began to lose ground.
Ahead and only three miles away lay the Solent—looking
alluring and peaceful in the rays of the
late afternoon sun. Without the aid of a steady
and favourable breeze or that of a powerful motor
the two yachts were not likely to gain their desired
harbour during the next six hours.</p>

<p>Keeping her now useless canvas set, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
dropped anchor. The <span class='it'>Merlin</span> continued to drift
until she came abreast of the Aberstour Sea Scouts’
craft; then she, too, let go her anchor.</p>

<p>“You were lucky to carry a breeze so long,”
shouted the Patrol Leader of the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>. “We’ve
been becalmed for quite two hours. We got
within a quarter of a mile of the lighthouse when
the tide changed. Look where we are now!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you use your motor?” asked
Craddock.</p>

<p>“We haven’t been able to get the thing going,”
was the reply. “We’ve been trying all day, and
we haven’t given up hope yet, although we do feel
a bit fed up.”</p>

<p>“Can I give you a hand?” asked Peter, who
possessed a sound knowledge of internal combustion
engines.</p>

<p>“If you will,” replied the Cornish Patrol
Leader.</p>

<p>Craddock jumped into the dinghy, cast off the
painter, and rowed to the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>. It required a
considerable amount of hard rowing, for the tide
was now swirling past and the dinghy was large
and heavy.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” he enquired, as he
gained the <span class='it'>Merlin’s</span> deck.</p>

<p>“Tried everything,” was the reply. “The
mag.’s all right; there’s quite a healthy spark,
but she won’t even fire her dope.”</p>

<p>Peter made the usual preliminary tests. Pouring
a few drops of petrol into the plug and placing
the latter on the cylinder, he found that the spirit
ignited readily enough; but, as the Patrol Leader
had said, the “dope” would not fire when the
plug was in position.</p>

<p>“Tried a spare plug?” asked Craddock.</p>

<p>“Four—no good,” was the terse and emphatic
reply.</p>

<p>Carefully overhauling the high-tension wire,
Peter called attention to the fact that the insulation
was rather worn at a spot where the wire crossed
one of the bearers of the cockpit floor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the Cornish lad, “I noticed
that; but if there is a short there’d be no spark
at all. As it is, the plug has quite a healthy
spark.”</p>

<p>“Well, try now,” suggested Craddock. “No;
don’t replace the floorboards. Stand astride of
the gap.”</p>

<p>At the first swing of the starting handle the
motor fired and continued to do so, “ticking
over” with the throttle only just open.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m dashed!” ejaculated the <span class='it'>Merlin’s</span>
engineer. “What did you do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Peter. “Now replace the
floorboards.”</p>

<p>As soon as the rectangular-shaped woodwork
was placed in position the motor stopped.</p>

<p>“That beats me!” remarked the Patrol Leader.</p>

<p>“There’s your trouble,” declared Craddock,
removing and overturning the floorboard. “See
that steel plate?”</p>

<p>He pointed to the double strip of metal forming
the edge of a slot to take the reversing lever.</p>

<p>“It’s bearing directly upon the high-tension
wire, and the continual vibration has damaged the
insulation. The motor fired when the floorboard
was up, but when it was in position the
metal touched the wire and caused a short circuit.
Wrap some insulating tape round the wire—it
would be as well to cut a notch in that beam to
let the wire bed itself better—and you won’t have
any more bother.”</p>

<p>“My word! You’re a smart fellow!” exclaimed
the other, with frank admiration.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” protested Craddock. “You see,
I had exactly the same trouble once on board our
old boat, the <span class='it'>Puffin</span>, and I had to get another
fellow to put it right.”</p>

<p>“ ’Tany rate, you’ve done a very Good Turn,”
declared Mr. Pendennis. “We’ll try and return
it by giving the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> a tow. I don’t say that
we’ll succeed against this tide, but we’ll have a
good shot at it.”</p>

<p>The Falmouth Scoutmaster hailed the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>“I say, Grant!” he exclaimed. “We’re going
to give you a tow. Do you know your way in?
I don’t, except for the directions in the ‘Channel
Pilot’; but which is Fort Victoria? Look here,
do you mind coming on board and piloting us?”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant accepted the invitation. Craddock
returned to the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, and preparations were
made to pass a hawser from the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> to the
other yacht. Both anchors were weighed simultaneously
and the strenuous effort began.</p>

<p>Slowly yet surely the two vessels approached
Hurst Channel. Ahead could be seen a confused
turmoil of broken sea as the pent-up water of the
Solent forced its way through the narrow passage
between Hurst Castle and the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>It was now that local knowledge came in most
usefully. Except for one point ominously named
“The Trap,” the beach at Hurst Castle is steep-to,
the depth increasing to fifteen fathoms within
a few yards of the shore. By keeping close in,
Mr. Grant knew that the full force of the tide
would not only be avoided, but that there would
also be found a tidal eddy in their favour.</p>

<p>“You can rely upon the motor, I hope?” he
enquired. “If it should go wrong, we’ll find
ourselves in a very dangerous situation.”</p>

<p>Receiving an assurance on that point, Mr.
Grant ordered the helm to be starboarded a
little.</p>

<p>Gradually the slow progress increased until,
aided by the counter-current, the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> and the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> seemed to jump ahead. They were now
within their own length of the beach. Ahead lay
“The Trap,” and off it a broiling tide which, if
it caught the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> on her port bow, would
swing her out into the full strength of the ebb.</p>

<p>Edging cautiously, the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> approached the
crucial spot. She appeared to stop dead. The
strain on the towing hawser eased. The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
continued to decrease her distance, making
straight for the dangerous ledge. To Brandon
at the helm it seemed as if a titanic hand was
gripping the keel and shaking the whole boat.
He could do nothing. The rudder seemed useless,
and yet the yacht was heading for destruction.</p>

<p>Suddenly the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> forged ahead. She had
crawled past the dangerous point and was now
aided by a favourable eddy. With a staggering
jerk the hawser took up the strain. The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
leapt ahead, her keel missing the steeply shelving
ledge by inches.</p>

<p>In another five minutes both craft were stemming
the relatively weak tide off the mud-flats of
the Hampshire shore.</p>

<p>“Near thing that,” remarked Heavitree. “I
thought we should have had to have jumped for
it that time.”</p>

<p>“If we had, we should have stood as much
chance as a mouse in a pail of water,” rejoined
Brandon, glancing at the maelstrom astern. “Next
time I think I’d rather wait till the tide turns.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XVIII &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Admiral</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“W</span>hat’s</span> that fellow staring at us for?”
asked Talbot.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Symington carelessly,
as he stooped to put a final polish on his
shore-going boots. “It’s the thing to do afloat.
Everyone does, and it’s taken as a sort of compliment
to the craft you happen to be aboard.”</p>

<p>“But, just you look at him,” persisted
Talbot.</p>

<p>It was the morning following the arrival of the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> and the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> in Lymington River. Both
craft were brought up on Long Reach and just
above the second beacon. As the east-going tide
would not run before the afternoon, and as it was
almost a hopeless proposition to attempt to stem
the adverse tide, the crews of both boats had
arranged to go ashore in the forenoon, and were
consequently “smartening themselves up” for
the occasion.</p>

<p>Symington gave a casual glance. Then he
looked a second time. Evidently Talbot’s wonder
was justifiable, for breasting the ebb-tide was an
open, centre-board sailing boat in the stern-sheets
of which sat the only occupant.</p>

<p>He was a bronzed-complexioned man of about
forty, with iron-grey hair and a white “torpedo”
beard. His beetling brows were conspicuous by
their long, white hairs, overhanging dark and
deep-set eyes. He wore a blue reefer suit and a
peaked cap cocked at a rakish angle over one eye.
As Talbot had remarked, he was staring—although
it looked more like a glare—straight at the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had anchored about fifty yards
lower down the stream than the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>, and was
in consequence nearer to the approaching boat.</p>

<p>Even as Symington looked the bearded man put
his helm down with the evident intention of
coming alongside.</p>

<p>“Someone to see you, sir!” he announced,
addressing Mr. Grant, who had just finished
shaving.</p>

<p>The rest of the crew of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> came on
deck. Talbot and Carline stood by with fenders;
Symington prepared to take the stranger’s painter;
while the others lined up behind Mr. Grant,
standing smartly at “alert.”</p>

<p>But instead of running alongside the man let
his sheets fly, with the result that the boat lost
way and, only just stemming the tide, remained
practically level with the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>Then he stood up, almost bursting blood-vessels
in his unaccountable anger.</p>

<p>“Confound you, sir!” he roared. “Don’t
you know who I am?”</p>

<p>“ ’Fraid I don’t,” replied Mr. Grant mildly.
“Unless,” he added cheerfully, “unless you are
the harbour master.”</p>

<p>“Insolence, sir! Rank insolence!” blared the
man. “Why don’t you salute? Why haven’t
you dipped your ensign? I’m the Admiral commanding
the Atlantic Fleet!”</p>

<p>For a moment the Scoutmaster was nonplussed.
Obviously the enraged individual was a lunatic
and possibly a dangerous one. The situation had
to be handled delicately. The best thing to do,
he decided, was to humour the man. Fortunately
the crew had taken their cue from their Scoutmaster
and had refrained from roaring with
laughter.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, sir,” said Mr. Grant. “I failed
to recognise you.”</p>

<p>“That’s no excuse,” stormed the man. “You’ve
failed to pay proper respect to your commanding
officer, sir! Consider yourself under arrest!”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” replied the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>The while he was working out a very difficult
problem. If the intruder were as fierce as he
looked—and in spite of his age he was active and
muscular—he was a positive danger. Perhaps
before the united efforts of the Sea Scouts could
place him under restraint he might inflict severe
injuries on some of them. Handicapped by his
injured hand, Mr. Grant realised that he could
do little from a physical point of view.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he could not continue to
temporise indefinitely. If Mr. Pendennis could
be communicated with, without exciting the man’s
suspicions, something might be done, for the
Cornish Scoutmaster was a huge, hefty fellow
with no small reputation as a wrestler in a county
where wrestling as a sport holds a high position.</p>

<p>Just then the madman noticed that his boat was
adrift. He had neglected to make fast the painter,
and owing to his strange behaviour the Sea Scouts
had not given the boat a thought. Already the
little sailing craft, with her sails still out, was
drifting to lee’ard.</p>

<p>“Quartermaster of the Watch!” shouted the
intruder. “Who gave you orders to take my
barge from the——”</p>

<p>He paused abruptly. In his disordered brain
was a faint realisation that there was no accommodation
ladder to this craft. Its absence puzzled
him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he grasped Carline by the shoulder
and hurled him overboard. It was done so swiftly
and unexpectedly that no one had time to raise
even a finger to attempt to prevent it; but the
next instant Brandon and Craddock threw themselves
upon the madman.</p>

<p>There was little room on the waterway for a
struggle—merely a space of about thirty inches
between the raised cabin-top and the side of the
yacht; but in spite of limited surroundings the
affray was a strenuous one.</p>

<p>To the credit of the two Sea Scouts it must be
recorded that neither lost his temper, in spite of
the fact that they had seen Carline tossed into the
ditch.</p>

<p>The madman fought desperately, using his fists
successfully. It was evident that he had been a
trained boxer; yet there was wanting the necessary
co-operation between the brain and his fists.</p>

<p>Contenting himself with parrying the man’s
deliberate blows, the Patrol Leader kept his
opponent busy while Craddock contrived to get
behind the infuriated intruder. Then, gripping
the man round his waist, Peter threw him on his
back upon the cabin-top.</p>

<p>The struggle was not yet over. Again and
again the maniac sought to regain his feet.
Wrenching one arm free, he struck out. Brandon
gripped him by the wrist and held on. Still the
man resisted; yet notwithstanding his fury he
made no effort to use his feet against his youthful
antagonists.</p>

<p>He was visibly tiring. So were Brandon and
Craddock, but not to such an extent. It was then
that Heavitree joined in the fray. Deftly passing
a rope round the madman’s ankle and taking a
turn with the end to one of the runners, he soon
had the man reduced to a state of helplessness;
while Brandon completed the business by securing
the fellow’s arms behind his back with his scarf.</p>

<p>Meanwhile one of the crew of the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> who
happened to be on deck had raised the alarm, and
the yacht’s dinghy, manned by four Sea Scouts,
with Mr. Pendennis in the stern-sheets, came at
top speed towards the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>At the same time Carline was returning with
the maniac’s boat. Finding himself overboard,
the Sea Scout thought that since he was in the
water he might just as well secure the drifting
boat. This he did. Then, lowering the centre-board
and trimming the sheets, he sailed the little
craft alongside the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> just as the <span class='it'>Merlin’s</span>
dinghy arrived upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Hello! What’s the trouble?” enquired
Scoutmaster Pendennis.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant tapped his forehead significantly.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” continued the Cornishman.
“Poor fellow! I wonder where he came from.
As a matter of fact, I thought you’d had a visit
from the escaped convict. Haven’t you heard?
It’s in this morning’s paper. A prisoner got away
from Parkhurst yesterday afternoon. It is supposed
that he stole a boat and crossed to the
mainland. There’s a boat missing at Yarmouth.
Any damage done?”</p>

<p>Brandon and Craddock, breathing heavily,
shook their heads. Heavitree had barked his
knuckles in the struggle, but decided that “it was
nothing to write home about.” The madman,
exhausted by his efforts, was lying comparatively
still, but apparently uninjured.</p>

<p>The rapid beats of a steamer’s paddles caused
a general rush to fend off the boats lying alongside
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>. One of the passenger boats
plying between Yarmouth and Lymington was
coming up the river and throwing out a tremendous
wash. Further down stream anchored
yachts were rolling heavily in the breaking swell,
while tons of water were receding from the mud-flats
in advance of the quickly moving vessel.</p>

<p>As she passed, one of the passengers standing
aft noticed the bound figure on the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> deck
and called his companions’ attention to it. Then,
raising his hands trumpet-wise to his mouth, he
shouted:</p>

<p>“We’ll come for him as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>The steamer continued on her way to the pier,
leaving the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> rolling so heavily in her swell
that Heavitree had to steady the helpless captive
lest he should be jerked overboard.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a large rowing boat with a
boatman and the two passengers from the steamer
came alongside.</p>

<p>“So you’ve got him, sir,” said one of the latter.
“I hope he didn’t give you much trouble.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” replied Mr. Grant. “Who is
he?”</p>

<p>The attendant, for such he was, explained.
The madman was an inmate of a private mental
hospital a few miles from Yarmouth. Usually he
was quite docile, but there were occasions when
he became violent. More than once by a display
of considerable cunning he had broken out of the
establishment, and invariably he had made his
way to the little seaport and had taken possession
of an unattended boat.</p>

<p>“We guessed he’d be making for Lymington,”
continued the man. “When I heard Mr. Lucas’s
boat was missing, I said to my mate, ‘The
Admiral’s up to his old trick again.’ We call him
The Admiral, because he’s always under the
delusion that he is one. Of course, the police
must come to the conclusion that the boat was
taken by the fellow who got away from Parkhurst
yesterday, though I told them they were wrong.
A desperate chap, six foot one such as he is,
wouldn’t risk showing himself in Yarmouth, if
he wanted to steal a boat. Glad we didn’t come
across him when we were looking for The Admiral
last night. He’s serving a long term for house-breaking
with violence, and I don’t envy the
policeman who has to tackle him. Well, sir,
we’ll take charge of The Admiral, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind in the least,” replied Mr. Grant.
“I suppose he won’t give trouble?”</p>

<p>“Bless you, no, sir!” declared the attendant.
“He’ll be as quiet as a lamb. Come on, Admiral!”
he continued, addressing the subject of his search.
“There’s a rehearsal this afternoon, and what will
happen if the first violin isn’t there?”</p>

<p>So saying, he removed the madman’s bonds and
helped him to his feet. The unfortunate man
stepped into the waiting boat as quietly as any
ordinary individual.</p>

<p>“How about this?” enquired the Scoutmaster,
pointing to the sailing boat.</p>

<p>“I’ll be along to take charge of her, sir,” said
the boatman. “You won’t be getting under way
afore the flood tide, I’ll allow?”</p>

<p>With the departure of the attendants and their
charge, Mr. Pendennis prepared to return to his
own craft.</p>

<p>“We won’t be starting before two o’clock, I
suppose,” he remarked. “We’ll carry our tide
right through to Chichester. Ought to get there
by eight with the breeze. By the way, how’s that
hand of yours, Grant? Oughtn’t you to see a
doctor and get it lanced?”</p>

<p>“No need,” replied Mr. Grant. “The poison’s
out and the wound is healing nicely. It will be
all right in a day or so. Now, lads! Who’s for
the shore?”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>f,</span> on leaving Lymington River, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>
hadn’t run on the mud; if the tide had not
changed and the wind fallen light; and if the

Scouts might have found themselves at the
rendezvous for the Jamboree at eight o’clock
that evening.</p>

<p>It was a combination of adverse circumstances.
Running the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> aground was excusable
but hardly avoidable. Many a yachtsman with
local knowledge has done much the same, for the
beacons, instead of marking the edge of the
channel, are some distance away from it and well
up on the mud. The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> “took the putty”
badly and, in spite of the <span class='it'>Merlin’s</span> efforts to tow
her off, she remained there for nearly two hours.</p>

<p>The change of the direction of the tidal stream
and the dropping of the wind, which finally
backed to due east, were conditions for which the
Sea Scouts could not be held responsible; but
the same could not be said in excuse for the
<span class='it'>Merlin</span> running out of petrol.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Sea Scout in charge of
the motor had examined the gauge of the petrol
tank, which registered eight gallons. Unfortunately
the indicator had stuck, and the actual
amount when the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> went to her consort’s
assistance was only one gallon. It was now <span class='it'>nil</span>.</p>

<p>This discovery was made when the two yachts
were abreast of Egypt Point and within a mile or
so of Cowes Harbour. In vain they attempted to
beat up for that anchorage. Gripped by the
steadily increasing foul tide they were rapidly
swept down the Solent until, realising that any
further efforts would only result in their being
carried more to the west’ard, they dropped anchor
off Newtown River.</p>

<p>“There’s a hamlet called Newtown and another
place called Shalfleet,” observed Mr. Pendennis,
after consulting the chart. “We may be able to
get petrol at one of them. Are any of your fellows
coming ashore with us?”</p>

<p>“We may as well go if we leave a couple of
hands to look after the yachts,” replied Mr.
Grant. “The glass is steady and the tide won’t
change for another five hours. It’s good holding
ground, and there’s no fear of either craft dragging
her anchor. Right-o! Who’ll volunteer to
remain?”</p>

<p>Craddock and Heavitree offered to act as ship-keepers.
Two Cornish Sea Scouts also elected to
stay on board the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>. The others manned the
two dinghies and prepared to make for the mouth
of the river.</p>

<p>“How about Molly?” asked Brandon. “Shall
we take her?”</p>

<p>The pup showed such a disinclination to go in
the boat that she was left behind. Usually she
was quite excited at the sight of the dinghy being
manned, and was one of the first to scramble over
the gunwale. But that was only when Craddock
was to form one of the party. She was fond of
everyone on board, even Eric Little; but she was
devoted to Peter. Where he went she would go,
but if he remained on board it required forcible
abduction to get the pup into the boat.</p>

<p>Left to themselves, Craddock and Heavitree
had quite an enjoyable afternoon. They fished,
exchanged semaphore and Morse messages with
the <span class='it'>Merlin’s</span> ship-keepers, wrote letters, and
watched passing shipping.</p>

<p>Six o’clock came, but there were no signs of
the two dinghies. The Sea Scouts had tea,
washed up and stowed away the things, and came
on deck again. Still the absent members of the
two crews failed to put in an appearance.</p>

<p>“What’s happened to the others?” asked Peter,
hailing the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they can’t find a garage or a place
where they sell petrol,” replied one of the Falmouth
lads. “I’ve been aloft to look, but there’s
only a small part of the harbour to be seen. It
runs away behind that hill to the right of the
entrance.”</p>

<p>“More likely they are high and dry on the
mud,” added Heavitree. “Ah, well! We aren’t
lonely, and we aren’t idle. I’ve caught enough
fish for supper for all hands.”</p>

<p>“If they are aground they can hardly be
blamed for that,” continued the Cornish Sea
Scout. “These tides are fair puzzlers. Down
our way we’re satisfied with two tides a day;
here people get four.”</p>

<p>Craddock agreed. It was his first experience
of the coast between Cowes and Weymouth,
where a second high water follows the first at
anything from two to four hours later. He had
also been used to a rise and fall of about eighteen
feet. Here the range of tide seemed to be about
six feet.</p>

<p>At sunset the main ebb was almost done. The
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, anchored nearer in shore than the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>,
was within fifty yards of the now exposed gravel
banks. Taking soundings, Peter found that the
depth was a fathom and a half.</p>

<p>“So we won’t ground at low tide,” he remarked
to his chum. “There’s nothing to worry about.
Let’s go below and make ourselves snug. It’s
pretty nippy this evening.”</p>

<p>Having lighted the riding-lamp and hoisted it
on the forestay the two lads retired to the saloon.
Soon they were making a literary feast, devouring
the pages of their favourite weekly paper. Breathlessly
they followed the fearfully exciting adventures.
The flight of time passed unheeded.
They had almost forgotten their immediate surroundings
in visualising a stalwart sergeant riding
hot-foot across the boundless prairie in close
pursuit of a much-wanted desperado.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Molly gave a low growl.</p>

<p>“Quiet, little girl!” exclaimed Peter.</p>

<p>But the pup refused to keep still. Clambering
up the three broad steps leading from the saloon
to the cockpit, she changed her growl to a succession
of shrill barks of defiance.</p>

<p>“What’s up, I wonder?” remarked Heavitree,
coming back to earth, or rather to his floating
home. “Are the others returning?”</p>

<p>“Don’t think so,” replied Peter, preparing to
go on deck. “Molly’s welcome is very different
from that.”</p>

<p>On gaining the cockpit Craddock stared in bewilderment.
It was some moments before he
grew accustomed to the change from the well
lighted cabin to the faint moonlight. When he
did he was all the more puzzled, for, instead of
land showing a few hundred yards to starboard,
there was nothing but an expanse of sea dotted
with the flashing light of numerous buoys. Then
he looked to port. There was the land—the low-lying
ground to the east of the entrance of Newtown
River. He had completely ignored the fact
that the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had swung to the young flood
tide.</p>

<p>“What is it, Molly?” he asked.</p>

<p>The pup, crouching with her forepaws planted
against the low rail, was barking furiously at a
dark object floating in the water at less than ten
yards from the yacht’s bows. In the faint moonlight
Craddock saw that it was a basket drifting
bottom upwards.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing, pup,” declared the lad.
“Haven’t you seen a drifting basket before?”</p>

<p>But Molly would not be silenced. She seemed
to be fascinated by the derelict wickerwork.</p>

<p>Then Craddock began to be interested, too.
And for a very good reason: the basket was not
drifting with the tide. It was moving decidedly
against it and slowly yet surely approaching the
<span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> bows.</p>

<p>“Come on deck, old man,” said Peter to his
chum, in a low voice; but Heavitree, who had
resumed his absorbing pastime, either did not
hear or did not want to.</p>

<p>Presently the basket disappeared from Peter’s
range of vision. From where he was standing in
the cockpit he could not see the surface of the
water in the vicinity of the yacht’s bows. He
heard the rasping of the wickerwork against the
<span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> side, and once more the basket appeared
in view, bobbing astern and now drifting naturally
with the tide.</p>

<p>Molly’s bark grew louder and shriller. She
had lost all interest in the basket and was
directing her attention to something under the
bows.</p>

<p>Before Craddock could go for’ard to investigate,
the dripping head and shoulders of a man
appeared above the rail. Then, obtaining a foothold
on the bobstay, the intruder swung himself
on the fore-deck, stood up, and steadied himself
by means of the forestay.</p>

<p>“Get that there dawg of yourn out of it afore
I ’as to ’urt it,” he growled.</p>

<p>In the semi-darkness the stranger seemed to
tower to a great height. Actually he was well
over six feet, though narrow across the chest. He
was clean-shaven, and wore an overcoat that was
many inches too short for him. He was bare-legged,
and it looked as if he were wearing shorts.
Water drained steadily from his meagre and
saturated garments.</p>

<p>“Come here, Molly!” exclaimed Peter, fearful
lest the intruder should carry out the alternative
he had mentioned.</p>

<p>The pup still refused.</p>

<p>The man, stooping suddenly, grasped the
animal by the scruff of the neck and stepped aft
as far as the mainmast.</p>

<p>“Ketch!” he said laconically. “Don’t want
to ’urt no dawg, I don’t.”</p>

<p>With that he tossed the pup into Craddock’s
hands, throwing her so gently that, beyond being
frightened, no harm was done to her.</p>

<p>“Naw,” continued the intruder, “me an’ you
are goin’ for a nice little cruise-like. ’Tain’t no
use kickin’. I’ve been a-watchin’ yer, an’ I knows
there’s only two of you. Ask for no trouble an’
you’ll get none. Got me?”</p>

<p>Just then Heavitree, hearing voices, was about
to come on deck. To him Peter handed the pup.</p>

<p>“Lock her up and get back here as soon as
you can,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Then he addressed the intruder. Already he
had no doubt as to the fellow’s identity. The ill-fitting
overcoat failed to conceal a rough suit of
grey cloth liberally bedecked with broad arrows.
Obviously this was the convict under sentence for
robbery with violence, and in all probability he
would not hesitate to take desperate measures to
prolong his spell of liberty. Yet, Peter recalled,
he had been gentle with a dumb animal even
though Molly had attempted to snap at his
gnarled fingers.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” demanded the Sea
Scout. “It’s no use coming here.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it, my young pal?” replied the convict.
“That’s for me to say. Now look ’ere: all I
want is a bite o’ food an’ summat to drink. Then
I’ll trouble you to ’and over any clothes belongin’
to that tall bloke I seed go ashore this arternoon.
Then you’ll put me across t’other side an’ you’ll
get my best thanks. If you don’t——’Ere, you,
get down out of it. You won’t be wanted this
trip.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/184.jpg' alt='' id='img184' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>The latter remarks were addressed to Heavitree,
who having placed Molly out of harm’s way had
come out of the saloon to “join in the argument,”
as he expressed it. Far from complying with the
convict’s demands he went to stand beside Craddock
and unobtrusively unshipped a heavy
belaying-pin. “Get out of it!” repeated the
convict. Heavitree raising his arm resolutely
remained where he was. Craddock gave one
glance in the direction of the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>. No one
was to be seen on her deck. More than likely her
two ship-keepers were amusing themselves below.
In any case, there was not much likelihood of help
in that direction. The two Sea Scouts on the
Cornish yacht were without a dinghy, and being
further out in the tideway, they would run a
serious risk of being carried away if they attempted
to swim to the aid of their brother-Scouts on the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span>. If Peter and Heavitree were to “win
through,” they would evidently have to do so on
their own merits.</p>

<p>Realising this, Craddock picked up the boat-hook
which was lying on the waterways by the
side of the cockpit coaming. It was a formidable
weapon, consisting of about eight feet of stout
ash pole terminating in a combined point and
hook of galvanised iron.</p>

<p>Armed resistance was one of the last things the
miscreant had counted upon. He had staked his
chances upon the likelihood of being able to
overawe a couple of lads, but he had failed to
estimate correctly the physical and moral fibre of
the average Sea Scout. As a general rule, the
burglar who employs brute force when dealing
with a weak and terrified householder is an arrant
coward, easily terrified when threatened with
corporal punishment. When he finds that “the
game is up,” he will refrain from violence because
he knows that on conviction his sentence will be
far heavier than if he had contented himself solely
with ordinary house-breaking. On the other
hand, if he thinks he can get clear he will not
hesitate to stun or wound the person who attempts
his capture.</p>

<p>The convict hesitated. He did not like the
look of the business end of the boat-hook, the
staff of which was held in a pair of firm, steady
hands. Nor did he relish the probability of a
crack across the head from the serviceable lump
of iron which Heavitree gripped in readiness.</p>

<p>“Be reasonable, chums!” he whined. “ ’Ere’s
a pore bloke wrongfully convicted who’s got a
chance to get clear. Be sports an’ give him a
’elping ’and.”</p>

<p>“We will,” agreed Peter grimly. “We’ll give
the police a helping hand, so you’d better surrender
and give no further trouble.”</p>

<p>“S’pose I’d better,” rejoined the convict
sullenly. “I sees myself back in quod, ’cause
’ere come your pals in their boat.”</p>

<p>Instinctively the two Sea Scouts turned their
heads to follow the direction of the crafty rogue’s
glance. It was exactly what the convict hoped
they would do.</p>

<p>In a trice he leapt across the cabin-top. Before
Peter could recover his guard the fellow was
within the wavering point of the boat-hook. The
next instant he grasped Heavitree’s right wrist,
rendering the belaying-pin useless as a weapon
either of defence or offence.</p>

<p>But there was one thing he forgot. Accustomed
to having a dry and comparatively unyielding
solid ground, he was quite unused to the motion
of a vessel. Even a forty-foot yacht responds
perceptibly to the weight of a person moving on
deck. In his wild onslaught he lost his balance.
His bare feet slipped on the wet painted canvas
of the cabin-top. He fell heavily, bringing Heavitree
down with him.</p>

<p>In vain Heavitree tried to get in his terrible
upper cut to the point. The convict’s face seemed
as if it were made of metal. He gave a grunt as
the Sea Scout’s fist jolted his chin, then with a
quick movement his fingers closed upon the lad’s
throat.</p>

<p>For a moment Craddock was unable to distinguish
friend from foe in the deep shadows of
the cockpit. Then he heard his chum’s choking
cry as he gasped for breath. Snatching another
belaying-pin from the rack, Peter brought the
iron bar down with considerable force upon the
back of the convict’s closely cropped head.</p>

<p>The man seemed to crumple up. He subsided
inertly across the body of the Sea Scout he had
tried to choke into insensibility.</p>

<p>Extricating Heavitree from his decidedly unpleasant
situation, Peter set his chum down upon
one of the seats in the cockpit. For several
minutes, Heavitree could do nothing but gasp,
swallowing mouthfuls of the pure ozone-laden
air, until his companion grew alarmed.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, I think,” spluttered Heavitree.
“I don’t think I’m hurt much, but I feel like a
jelly. What’s happened to the chap? You
haven’t killed him?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” replied Peter. “His skull is too
thick for that. I gave him a tap to quiet him.
Hello! more of them?”</p>

<p>A pair of hands appeared over the side of the
yacht, followed by a head. It was one of the crew
of the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>. Alarmed by the commotion on
board the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, he had boldly dived overboard
and swum to the aid of his brother-Scouts. It
was a risky thing to do, and by the time he had
battled against the strong flood tide he was nearly
exhausted. Peter assisted the lad on board and
explained matters.</p>

<p>“My word!” exclaimed the Cornish lad.
“This is some trip! We can’t say the voyage
has been dull, can we? Cheerful looking fellow,
isn’t he? Hadn’t we better secure him before
he comes round?”</p>

<p>“He looks as if he is about to recover consciousness,”
said Peter.</p>

<p>“In that case we’ll get busy,” rejoined the
<span class='it'>Merlin’s</span> representative. “There’s no need to
lash him up. Let me show you how we do
things down our way.”</p>

<p>So saying, the Cornish Sea Scout picked up the
mop which was lying on deck.</p>

<p>“Got another stick like this?” he asked.</p>

<p>Craddock produced a spare handle from one of
the lockers.</p>

<p>“Capital!” exclaimed the other approvingly,
and set to work to secure the still insensible man.
This he did by inserting one handle in one leg
of the convict’s shorts and passing lashings round
both the knee and the ankle. The other leg was
dealt with similarly, with the result that one end
of each mop handle projected about six inches
beyond the man’s feet, while, since he would be
unable to bend his lower limbs, he would be
unable to rise.</p>

<p>“We’ll secure his wrists later,” remarked the
Cornish lad. “We must give the fellow a chance
to recover.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Heavitree. “Oars!”</p>

<p>The others listened intently. Above the gentle
sighing of the wind in the yacht’s rigging came
the sound of the regular beats of oars. The long-absent
Sea Scouts with their respective Scoutmasters
were returning.</p>

<p>“Got any grub ready, Peter?” shouted
Brandon, when within hailing distance. “We’re
famishing.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, old son,” replied Craddock, “but
we’ve been too busy entertaining. Matter of fact,
sir,” he continued, addressing Mr. Grant, “we’ve
a convict on board. What shall we do with him?”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XX &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Last Lap</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“W</span>e</span> don’t want him,” declared Mr. Grant.
“Why didn’t you signal to the shore?
The place is stiff with warders and other people
searching for him. Well, what happened?”</p>

<p>While Craddock was relating the somewhat
alarming incident Brandon got busy with his
electric torch. It was not long before his “general
call” was acknowledged, and a message to the
effect that the convict had been recaptured and
was on board was flashed for the information of
the search party.</p>

<p>Back came the reply: “Thanks. Will send
boat to fetch him at once.”</p>

<p>“And what happened to you chaps?” asked
Heavitree.</p>

<p>“We got stuck in the mud—properly,” admitted
Brandon ruefully. “I never saw such a
place for mud. We tried to land at one place
and couldn’t. Then we went on and found an
old wharf. Talbot remained as boat-keeper for
both dinghies while the rest of us tramped into
Shalfleet. By the time we had looked round and
Mr. Pendennis had bought the petrol we found
both boats high and dry. Talbot did his best to
keep them afloat, but it was of no use. In fact,
he stuck twenty yards from shore, and the mud
was so soft that he couldn’t get back. He’s been
sitting in the dinghy for hours. We had had some
grub, and now we’re frightfully hungry. Talbot
hasn’t had anything to eat since we pushed off
from the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.”</p>

<p>Already the stove was lighted and preparations
under way for a belated meal. Presently, following
a hail of “Yacht ahoy!” a large rowing boat
with two boatmen and four armed warders came
alongside.</p>

<p>The convict, who was now conscious, was
transhipped. The head warder asked for particulars.</p>

<p>“Smart bit of work,” he declared admiringly,
when Craddock had told his plain, unvarnished
tale. “He’s a desperate character with a black
record. Well, young man, you’ve jolly well earned
the reward offered for his apprehension.”</p>

<p>Peter shook his head.</p>

<p>“We don’t want it, do we, Heavitree?” he
replied. “It’s too much like blood-money.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” declared the warder. “You’re
entitled to it. You’ve rendered a public service.”</p>

<p>“S’pose that’s one way of looking at it,”
admitted the lad. “All the same, I don’t like the
idea of touching the money. As a matter of fact,
Molly earned it as much as we did. Couldn’t we
give the reward to that Society for—you know
what I mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“ ‘Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.’ Yes, that’s rather a good wheeze,
Peter,” agreed the Scoutmaster. “Well, now,
it’s quite about time this party broke up.”</p>

<p>Taking the hint, the warders removed their
prisoner, who accepted the situation philosophically,
especially as Craddock and Heavitree had
made no mention to the authorities of the fact
that he had used violence.</p>

<p>“He didn’t hurt our pup, so we simply felt
we had to let him down lightly,” explained
Peter.</p>

<p>Very soon the crew of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were deep in
slumber. They did not turn out till late in the
forenoon for two reasons. They wanted to arrive
at Chichester Harbour “as fresh as paint”; it
was practically useless to attempt to set sail until
the west-going tide eased considerably. By this
time the Aberstour Sea Scouts had learnt to
respect the fierce tides of the Solent.</p>

<p>When the lads did turn out, Brandon went on
deck to haul down the riding-light. Then, to
his surprise, he discovered that the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“She’s stolen a march on us on the last lap,”
declared Heavitree when the Patrol Leader announced
the astonishing news.</p>

<p>“Well, she hasn’t got far,” added Carline.
“Unless, of course, she’s made use of her
motor.”</p>

<p>“We would have heard it,” remarked Craddock.
“Her exhaust is a very noisy affair.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they thought that we gave them the
slip at Falmouth,” suggested Talbot. “One or
two of the fellows looked a bit doubtful, as if
we were pulling their legs, when we explained
how it happened. So they’re taking a rise out
of us.”</p>

<p>“Stop arguing!” exclaimed Brandon. “Don’t
go hanging on to the slack, but get your
breakfasts. The sooner we get under way the
better.”</p>

<p>By the time the meal had been dispatched
and everything below made ship-shape the tide
had slackened. There was a light southerly
breeze which would enable the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> to romp
full and bye up the Solent, and, unless the wind
changed in direction, would take her to Chichester
Bar without having to tack. It was now nine
o’clock. High water at Spithead would occur at
four, and if the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were to make the rendezvous
that day, she must arrive off the bar not
later than five.</p>

<p>All plain sail was set, the anchor was weighed,
and then main and mizzen topsails were sent
aloft. Finally, the spinnaker was set with the
tack at the bowsprit-end. In fact, every stitch
of canvas that could be set was brought into
use.</p>

<p>It was a delightful sail. On the starboard hand
the crew could enjoy a close view of the well-wooded
Isle of Wight, while to port they could
discern an expanse of the New Forest and the
entrance to Southampton Water.</p>

<p>Through Cowes Roads the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> tore with
wind and tide. Here they saw for the first time
the Mecca of the yachting world with its swarm
of pleasure craft of all sizes and types either
anchored or under way. Sailing yachts, motor
craft, pleasure steamers thronged the Roads;
while further out liners, tramps, and warships
added to this picture of merchant activity. There
were aeroplanes and flying boats manœuvring,
the latter “taking off” from the surface of the
water with surprising ease.</p>

<p>Just abreast of the Old Castle Point buoy,
Brandon called attention to a couple of cutters,
both of which flew the burgee with the <span class='it'>fleur de lys</span>.
They were on a converging course to that of the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, and in all probability they would soon
come within hailing distance.</p>

<p>But Brandon did not wait for that. Producing
a pair of hand flags, he proceeded to semaphore
the approaching craft.</p>

<p>“They are Sea Scouts making for the Jamboree,
sir,” he announced. “One is from Poole,
the other from Weymouth. I’ll ask them if
they’ve seen the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> pass, since they brought
up in Cowes Harbour last night.”</p>

<p>The reply was in the negative; but, the Poole
cutter’s signaller added, a large motor yacht
passed making for the east’ard with two Sea
Scouts’ galleys in tow.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we’re going to be a merry
party,” observed Symington. “All roads lead
to Chichester Harbour.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What’s that place,
sir?”</p>

<p>He pointed to a large building flanked by two
towers and standing on a hill covered with grass
of a remarkably vivid hue.</p>

<p>“That’s Osborne House,” replied the Scoutmaster.
“It used to be a royal residence. Queen
Victoria died there. See that long pier ahead,
Talbot? That’s Ryde Pier. Steer to pass about
a quarter of a mile from its head. We’re moving,
by Jove! At this rate we’ll soon make Chichester
Harbour.”</p>

<p>The three yachts were now almost in line, the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> being to wind’ard. They were keeping
practically level. If anything, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was
gaining slightly.</p>

<p>“We’re showing them a clean pair of heels,
sir!” remarked Talbot, with no uncertain display
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Yes, because this wind suits us,” replied Mr.
Grant. “If it headed us, and we had to beat to
wind’ard, they’d whack us hollow. A ketch is no
match for a cutter at that game, so I wouldn’t
chip those fellows if I were you. They might
have the laugh of us before very long.”</p>

<p>“There’s a rowing boat with a Scout flag over
there, sir,” reported Craddock.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant levelled his glasses. A double-sculler
manned by three lads in Sea Scouts’ rig
was coming out of Wootton Creek. She had just
drawn clear of the outer beacon and was pointing
towards Ryde.</p>

<p>“Surely those chaps aren’t going to the
Jamboree,” remarked Peter. “Not in that
cockleshell.”</p>

<p>“They’ve a lot of gear in the boat,” declared
Mr. Grant. “I shouldn’t be at all surprised if
they are making for Chichester Harbour.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long way to row,” added Brandon tentatively.</p>

<p>“Down helm a bit,” ordered Mr. Grant.
“We’ll see if they are bound there. If so, we’ll
offer them a tow.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> overhauled the boat. The
crew of the latter continued to pull steadily.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound?” hailed the Patrol
Leader, as the ketch drew near.</p>

<p>“Chichester.”</p>

<p>“Want a tow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather.”</p>

<p>The oarsmen boated their oars, the bowman
coiling up the painter ready to make a cast.</p>

<p>Brandon was too experienced to attempt to
pick up the boat with the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> going at such a
speed. Making a wide sweep, he brought the
ketch head to wind within an oar’s length of the
frail double-sculler.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better get them all on board,
sir?” enquired the Patrol Leader. “The skiff
will tow lighter and easier if we do.”</p>

<p>In double quick time the three Sea Scouts
boarded the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>. Their boat, with a double
painter rove as a matter of precaution, was dropped
astern of the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> dinghy and the ketch was
again put on her former course. By this time
the Weymouth and Pool cutters had drawn ahead
to a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile; but,
sportsman-like, they had backed their head-sails
to enable the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> to recover her lead.</p>

<p>“You fellows looked like having a long pull,”
remarked Craddock to the three youths whose
jerseys bore the inscription, “Third Wootton
Bridge Sea Scouts.” “Bit risky, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“We weren’t going to be out of it,” explained
the Second. “Our Troop left yesterday in the
<span class='it'>Pixie</span>. We couldn’t get away. I work at a garage.
Jim, here, is at a baker’s; and Tim has a job at
the yacht-yard. At the last lap, so to speak, we
got the time off, and Tim’s boss lent us this
double-sculler.”</p>

<p>“You might have found yourselves in difficulties
off Chichester Bar,” observed Mr. Grant.
“There’s often a nasty sea running there, I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” admitted the Second. “But we
weren’t going to risk that in that sort of boat.
We were going to row as far as Ryde, where the
skipper of a motor tug promised to tow us across
to Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how that would help you very
much,” commented the Scoutmaster. “You
would still have to get into Chichester Harbour.”</p>

<p>“Inland water all the way, sir,” declared the
lad. “There’s a channel between Portsmouth
and Langston Harbour, and another between
Langston and Chichester. It’s all right for small
boats, but you couldn’t do it because of the
bridges, unless you unship your masts.”</p>

<p>Past a couple of “scrapped” monitors, the
unwieldy appearance and huge guns of which
afforded considerable interest to the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span>
crew, the ketch tore through the water. Off
Ryde they sighted two other craft—a yawl and
a converted lifeboat—both of which bore the
distinguishing flag of the Sea Scout brotherhood.</p>

<p>“Now, where do we make for, sir?” asked
Brandon.</p>

<p>“Steer for that fort,” replied Mr. Grant,
indicating a circular structure painted in black
and yellow squares and rising sheer out of the
sea.</p>

<p>“Is that a fort?” enquired Talbot. “It looks
more like a gigantic cheese. Why, there are two
more!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we have to pass between the pair,”
continued the Scoutmaster. “See that low-lying
belt of trees? That’s Hayling. The entrance to
Chichester Harbour is just beyond.”</p>

<p>Presently half a dozen sailing craft were noticed
on the port quarter. These comprised the Portsmouth
and Gosport contingent of Sea Scouts,
while astern a couple of motor launches each
towing two whalers announced their identity as
part of Southampton’s representation at the
forthcoming Jamboree.</p>

<p>By this time there were nearly twenty yachts
and boats within a radius of half a mile all making
for a common point—the entrance to Chichester
Harbour. Many Sea Scout craft had already
arrived. Others were on the way, not only from
the West, but from the East Coast. Provided
the weather held, the success of the Jamboree
seemed assured.</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness we’re not leading the
procession,” exclaimed Mr. Grant. “I’ll gladly
allow someone else to show us the way in. From
all accounts it’s a very tricky and badly marked
entrance, so we must be thankful we haven’t to
grope and scrape over the Bar.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see any entrance,” said Craddock.</p>

<p>Viewed from seaward the coast-line appeared
to consist of an unbroken line of low-lying, sandy
shore with a few houses and trees, extending
eastward as far as the eye could reach until only
the tree-tops showed above the horizon in the
neighbourhood of Selsea Bill. Ahead, as the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was now pounding, were masses of white
foam as the rollers broke on the flat shoals of the
dangerous Winners. Yet the leading craft held
unswervingly on their course, as if they meant
to hurl themselves to destruction upon those
formidable surf-swept sandbanks.</p>

<p>Presently a small white motor boat was sighted
ahead and quite a mile from the beach. She,
too, displayed the Scout burgee, and as each
approaching craft drew level with her a uniformed
official shouted directions to the newcomers.</p>

<p>“What yacht is that?” demanded the Commissioner
as the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> drew near. “Where
are you from? Good. What’s your draught?
Four feet; then you’ve plenty of water. Keep
close to the west shore inside the entrance until
you sight a buoy on your starboard hand.
Then port helm and carry on up the boomed
channel.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” replied Mr. Grant, and the
motor boat forged ahead to interview the next
arrival and to tell her to heave-to until the tide
made sufficiently for her draught to cross the
bar.</p>

<p>“What a topping place!” exclaimed Craddock
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>His appreciation was justifiable; for, although
the approach to Chichester Harbour presents a
dreary aspect, the view when once within its
shelter is superb; while the spacious land-locked
expanse with its three principal arms afforded
miles of safe yet entrancing sailing.</p>

<p>After following a well-marked channel for about
three miles and making a gentle bend to starboard,
the leading craft began to reduce canvas.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> followed suit; then a regular forest
of masts appeared to occupy the whole width of
the waterway, while ashore a small village of tents
accommodated those Sea Scouts whom circumstances
had prevented from living and sleeping
afloat. Conspicuous amongst the floating community
was a large yacht flying the characteristic
burgee of the Chief Sea Scout, and displaying the
International Code Signal: KY—“Anchor as
convenient.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> brought up on
the fringe of the fleet and well sheltered by the
curving arms of a sandy bay. Eighty yards or so
away was a little pier fronting the lines of tents
and affording means of landing at any state of
the tide. Canvas was then stowed and ropes
coiled away. Then for the first time the crew of
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were at leisure to take in the animated
scene.</p>

<p>Suddenly Heavitree turned and smacked Craddock
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Peter, old son!” he exclaimed joyously,
“aren’t you thunderingly glad you’re a Sea
Scout?”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XXI &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Eve of the Jamboree</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“I</span> can’t</span> see any sign of the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>,” declared
Brandon, after scanning the numerous craft
at anchor. Already, during the last half-hour
new arrivals had taken up their berths, so that
the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was by no means on the fringe of the
fleet.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” rejoined Peter. “I wonder
where she is?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make enquiries,” said Mr. Grant, overhearing
the conversation. “I must go aboard the
Chief Sea Scout’s yacht to report our arrival and
will find out whether the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> has arrived.
Bring the dinghy alongside, please, Brandon.”</p>

<p>The three Wootton Sea Scouts had taken their
departure and were alongside their parent craft
when their arrival was greeted with acclamation
by their chums.</p>

<p>Spic-and-span in their best jerseys, Brandon
and Craddock manned the dinghy and rowed
their Scoutmaster to the flagship, which was
surrounded by a swarm of small boats and
invaded by dozens of Scoutmasters attending
a conference on the programme for the next ten
days.</p>

<p>Having put Mr. Grant on board, Brandon and
his chum “laid off,” keeping their dinghy clear
of the yacht’s accommodation ladder. Then they
got busy, “easing their jaw tackle,” to use a
nautical expression, for the crews of the various
dinghies were holding an informal jamboree on
their own account and exchanging reminiscences.</p>

<p>There could be little doubt that the great
gathering of Sea Scouts would turn out to be a
huge success. Not only were the neighbouring
Troops well represented; some came from Great
Yarmouth, Lowestoft, Grimsby, and Hull, and
even from far-off Aberdeen. From the West
Coast, the Clyde was well represented, as well as
Troops from the Mersey, Pembroke, Swansea,
Cardiff, and Bristol. All these Troops were
fortunate in possessing fairly large and seaworthy
craft, many of them “drifters” with auxiliary
motors.</p>

<p>Other Sea Scouts living in inland districts—it
may sound strange to have to relate, but most
efficient Troops have been formed at places on
various rivers—had not been deterred from
appearing at the Jamboree. Some of them—those
from Nottingham, for example—had made the
voyage by canal as far as Godalming, completing
the journey by having their whalers placed on rail.
Others, unable to make use of the inland waterways,
had come the whole way by rail; while one
enterprising Troop from Worcester had demonstrated
how grit and ingenuity could surmount
almost any obstacle.</p>

<p>Their craft was a 27-foot ex-naval whaler and
was too long to be accommodated on an ordinary
railway goods truck. Besides, they were not well
off and could ill afford the expense. But they
were determined to be present at the Jamboree,
and they were. They had constructed a special
carriage mounted on a pair of heavy motor-lorry
wheels. This they attached to the Scoutmaster’s
car, placing the whaler on the “cradle.” Some
of the crew travelled in the boat; others by cycle,
since the lumbering vehicle could not go more
than eight or ten miles an hour. At night they
slept in the boat, which was covered with a waterproof
awning.</p>

<p>Others, possessing smaller boats, had trekked
to the rendezvous; while in many cases Troops
had arrived without craft of any description and
were accommodated in tents.</p>

<p>Not only was Great Britain well represented.
There were contingents from France, Belgium
and Holland, and quite a strong Troop of hefty,
flaxen-haired, fair-complexioned Sea Scouts from
Denmark, most of whom spoke English and had
already made the acquaintance of British Scouts
at the recent Copenhagen meeting.</p>

<p>The organisation, too, was as perfect as human
experience could devise. One of the chief
considerations, an ample supply of good drinking
water, was provided. There was an efficient
transport service between the landing-place and
the city of Chichester, from whence provisions
and stores were obtained. Special precautions
had been taken to provide a safe bathing-place
under strict supervision; while a proper postal
service had been instituted.</p>

<p>This much and more Brandon and Craddock
learnt from their new-found chums, and apparently
there was much forthcoming about which
the lads were as yet metaphorically “at sea.”</p>

<p>In about half an hour, Mr. Grant appeared on
deck and was rowed back to the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>.</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Merlin</span> hasn’t reported, lads,” he announced.
“Perhaps she’s had to put in somewhere.
It’s no use expecting her this evening.
There’s not enough water on the Bar until
to-morrow morning. Now, Eric, my lad, I
suppose the next thing to be done is to hand
you over to your relations.”</p>

<p>“Surely, sir, there is no immediate hurry,”
protested the stowaway. “If you have no objection,
perhaps I might be permitted to remain for
part of the impending entertainment? It occurred
to me, sir, that I should like very much to become
a Sea Scout.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grant turned to his crew.</p>

<p>“What shall we say, lads?” he asked.</p>

<p>There was a unanimous response in favour of
Eric being allowed to stop on board. In spite of
his old-fashioned ways, the boy had made himself
well liked.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” agreed the Scoutmaster.
“I’ll run into Chichester to-morrow morning and
see your uncle. But I’m afraid we can’t make
you a Sea Scout. You’re not old enough, Eric;
but there’s no reason why you shouldn’t become
a Cub, and then when you are old enough you
can become a Scout. Now, lads, who’s for the
shore? A good sharp tramp is the thing. One
of you must remain on board. Who’ll volunteer?”</p>

<p>Talbot said he would.</p>

<p>“Good man!” exclaimed Mr. Grant. “Keep
a smart look-out for signals from the Chief Sea
Scout’s yacht. That’s about all, I think. By the
by, we’ll have to patch up the dinghy’s gunwale
to-morrow. It looks a bit of a wreck.”</p>

<p>With the exception of the volunteer ship-keeper,
all hands went ashore, leaving the dinghy
on the hard. Proceeding between the avenue of
tents where swarms of Sea Scouts were in various
stages of “getting all ship-shape,” they gained
the open country—a flat but rather pleasing bit
of Sussex lying between the harbour and the
open sea.</p>

<p>“How firm the sand is!” exclaimed Carline
when the lads gained the seashore. “Look!
There are fellows riding bicycles on it.”</p>

<p>“And isn’t the tide out?” added Wilson.
“When we came in there weren’t any shoals
showing.”</p>

<p>“That’s why we had to choose high-water,”
remarked Mr. Grant. “Those shoals, although
consisting of sand, are quite as dangerous as
rocks. A vessel might be pounded to bits in a
few minutes if she chanced to get ashore in heavy
weather. There’s hardly any wind this evening—it’s
almost a flat calm—but you can see the
rollers breaking on the exposed edge of the shoals.
This harbour happens to be the worst beaconed
on the south coast, and in some respects one of
the most dangerous ones. If it comes on to blow
for any length of time, we might be kept here for
a month.”</p>

<p>“How jolly that would be!” exclaimed Wilson.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’d feel rather fed-up before
the month had passed,” observed the Scoutmaster.
“Any place, however much it appeals
to you at first, becomes positively irksome if
you’re kept there against your inclinations. Well,
there’s no sign of the <span class='it'>Merlin</span> in the offing. It’s a
pity, because it looks as if she won’t be able to
take part in the opening sailing race to-morrow
afternoon for the Silver Cup.”</p>

<p>“Are we racing, sir?” asked Craddock eagerly.</p>

<p>“Rather.”</p>

<p>“Good egg, sir!” exclaimed Peter.</p>

<p>“Time to be on our return journey,” observed
Mr. Grant, consulting his wristlet watch. “We
must be on board before sunset.”</p>

<p>His listeners wondered why. They soon found
out; for on returning to the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> they noticed
the Sea Scouts on the various craft mustered on
deck. A bugle sounded. Everyone stood at the
Alert, while a forest of burgees and ensigns
fluttered to their respective decks. Then in the
gathering gloom innumerable riding-lights were
hoisted in position.</p>

<p>It was the eve of the Jamboree.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XXII &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Race for the Cup</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>unctually</span> at 1.45 on the following
afternoon the eventful race for the Silver
Cup started. Nine yachts, each measuring thirty
feet or more on the water-line, were towed into
position and anchored. There they swung to
the weak flood tide with canvas stowed just as
if they had “brought-up” for the rest of the
day.</p>

<p>On board the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, the third from the starboard
end of the line, four very serious Sea Scouts,
with Mr. Grant in command, sat breathlessly
waiting for the starting gun. Although the conditions
governing the race were new to them—in
the old <span class='it'>Puffin</span> they had always had a flying
start following a five-minute gun—they realised
they had a fighting chance provided they did
their very best and did not bungle; for not
until after the races were completed would the
name of the winning yacht be known. That
was one of the surprises of racing under a sealed
handicap.</p>

<p>“Fifty seconds!” announced Mr. Grant
calmly. “Stand by! Fifty-five .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fifty-six
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fifty-seven .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fifty-eight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fifty-nine.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“<span class='sc'>Bang!</span>”</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the flash of the starting
gun the hitherto practically motionless crews of
the competing craft were figuratively galvanised
into activity. In as short a time as possible, the
bare poles would be hidden by the towering
canvas, anchors would be weighed, and the
vessels would leap forward on the determined
contest.</p>

<p>On board the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, although her crew had
had plenty of practice in getting under way, they
had not had to take into consideration the fact
that at a few yards’ distance on either side other
crews were doing the same thing. Besides, they
were short-handed, five being the maximum
number allowed. The rest of the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> complement
were ashore, where, in common with
several hundred Sea Scouts and other spectators,
they were yelling themselves hoarse with excitement.</p>

<p>Brandon and Craddock, casting off the tyers,
hauled away at main and peak halliards. Heavitree
and Carline ran for’ard to attach the foresail
to the forestay by means of the hanks, and to run
the jib out on the bowsprit ready to hoist. By
the time the mainsail was set Heavitree, who was
chosen for this particular work by reason of his
strength, broke out the anchor and got it inboard.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the racing of the anchor,
Mr. Grant put the helm hard-a-starboard, Brandon
tended the mainsheet, while the two hands for’ard
set both jib and staysail.</p>

<p>As soon as the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> forged ahead, Peter and
the Patrol Leader set and trimmed the mizzen.
This done, all hands went quietly to their racing
station and awaited orders.</p>

<p>Now for the first time since the starting gun
Peter was able to take notice of what the other
competing yachts were doing. Smart though the
<span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew had been in getting under way,
there were two craft which had executed the
manœuvre in quicker time and already had established
a useful lead. One was a centre-board
cutter from the Humber, a wholesome looking
craft; the other, also a cutter, belonging to a
Plymouth Troop. Slightly to lee’ard, and with
her hands still engaged in sheeting home their
canvas, was a Poole ex-fishing boat rather
noted for her speed and weatherly qualities.
A few yards astern was a deep-draughted
Bristol pilot cutter. Apparently she had trouble
with her peak-halliard blocks, and a couple of
Sea Scouts were swarming aloft to set things
right.</p>

<p>All these craft were close-hauled on the starboard
tack. The rest of the competitors, including
two who had collided at the start,
were heading towards the Bosham side of the
channel.</p>

<p>So far so well. Peter had never known the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> to move so fast in such a light wind. For
one thing, she was no longer hampered by her
dinghy. That impediment was for the present
unnecessary and had been left ashore.</p>

<p>But clean-heeled though the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was,
there were others who were faster. Although
Mr. Grant, by keeping her “full,” got the
very best out of the yacht, she could neither
point so high nor travel as fast as two of the
cutters.</p>

<p>On the fore-deck of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, Heavitree lay
motionless, keeping well down to minimise wind-resistance.
The rest of the crew stationed aft
were as silent and immobile as statues. They
realised that the race was not a game. It was
something that required every effort of mind and
body on the part of each member of the crew.
Even to move about unnecessarily might mean
the loss of the race, for even in a craft of the size
of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> it would be adversely sensitive to
the alteration of “trim” should any of the crew
begin “jumping about.”</p>

<p>Now the leading yacht on the starboard tack
was nearing the edge of the deep-water channel.
She drew more than the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, and the problem
that confronted Mr. Grant was whether to put
the helm down at once, or, taking advantage of
the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> smaller draught, carry on and pass
astern and consequently to wind’ard of his
antagonist. He had to make up his mind quickly.
He realised, too, that against the flood tide he
might find slack water, or even a counter-eddy
close to the hidden mud-flat.</p>

<p>He chose the latter alternative.</p>

<p>“Stand by to go about!” he ordered; then
“Lee-o!”</p>

<p>Quickly yet deliberately Brandon let the head-sheets
fly. Round came the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> slowly yet
surely, shooting ahead in the slack water and
actually overlapping the leading cutter. But the
advantage was only temporary, although it counted
in the long run. Unable to point as high as his
rival, the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> speed diminished. The only
possible course was to up-helm slightly and to
romp under the Humber yacht’s lee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Plymouth vessel had gone about
and was making short but useful tacks; while
the Bristol yacht, holding on too long, was
aground with her crew feverishly working in an
attempt to get her off.</p>

<p>Half-way across the Channel, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, now
on the port tack, met the competing craft, which
had made for the northern side of the fairway.
By the “rules of the road” she had to give way.
Now came the test of the helmsman’s skill and
sound judgment. The slightest error might
result in disaster, for which the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> would be
blamed. Even the faintest contact between her
and one of the yachts on the starboard tack would
disqualify her. In addition there were two boats
abeam of her and two more astern. No need to
worry about the last two. They had to avoid
those ahead as well as those converging on the
opposite tack.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> passed the first of the starboard-tack
boats at less than a couple of yards to lee’ard.
For a brief instant, as the lowering canvas of the
latter blanketed the wind, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> recovered
from her heel; her sails shivered, the mainsheet
sagged. Then at the next moment she
staggered as she felt the full force of the breeze,
and, luffing, shot magnificently across the bows
of the next competitor.</p>

<p>It was exhilarating work. Even in that land-locked
harbour, the dead beat to wind’ard with
a weather-going tide sent the spindrift flying over
the bows. Yet the disconcerting fact was now
apparent. The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, owing to her rig and
generous amount of deadwood fore and aft, was
hopelessly out of it against the performance of
most of her competitors in the thrash to wind’ard.
She could only hold on gamely. Even the Bristol
boat was afloat once more and was tearing along
in grand style. Astern a Dover yacht was in
difficulties with a torn jib; while a Newhaven
yawl and a Grimsby cutter, both under-canvassed,
were indulging in a ding-dong race on their own
account.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes from the start the two leading
competitors were rounding the mark buoy.
The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was still a good two hundred yards
from it. Four other boats, bunched together,
were bearing down on the port tack for the
turning-point.</p>

<p>As luck would have it the second boat’s bowsprit
was almost level with the leader’s counter as
they prepared to go about at the mark buoy.
This is what is termed “establishing an overlap,”
and the second craft has the right to hail the
other to give her more room. If, however, there
is no overlap the leading craft can carry on,
leaving the other to get out of her way and pass
outside her.</p>

<p>At this critical moment a collision occurred.
The leading yacht, with her mainsail ripped, fell
away, leaving the second with her bowsprit
smashed off close to the stem-head and her jib
trailing in the water.</p>

<p>“Rough luck!” commented the sportsman-like
Craddock. “They’re out of it.”</p>

<p>But Peter was wrong. The yacht with the
damaged bowsprit was automatically disqualified;
but the other, in spite of the sorry condition
of her mainsail, bore away and continued to
race.</p>

<p>Presently it was the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> turn to round the
mark buoy. She had it all to herself, for the
bunch of four were already on the homeward run,
while the remaining two competitors were well
astern.</p>

<p>“Stand by!” cautioned Mr. Grant. “Ready
with the spinnaker!”</p>

<p>Moving as softly as cats, Carline and Heavitree
prepared the halliards and out-haul of the spinnaker.
Round swept the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, making the
mark buoy curtsey in her wash. Over flew the
boom in a deliberate gybe.</p>

<p>“Up spinnaker!” ordered the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>In double quick time the huge but light triangular
sail was set and sheeted home. Now the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was at her best. Running was her strong
point. The foam frothed at her cut-water and
trailed astern in an ever-diverging double wake.
In five minutes she had overtaken the partly
crippled Plymouth cutter, the crew of which, far
from being dismayed, had also set spinnaker.
She was making a gallant fight against long odds,
and the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew broke a prolonged silence
by giving the West Country Sea Scouts a rousing
cheer.</p>

<p>A stern chase is proverbially a long one, but
slowly yet surely the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was decreasing the
distance between the now straggling procession
of leading boats. The task entailed ceaseless
vigilance on the part of the Scoutmaster. An
accidental gybe at this state of the proceedings
would be disastrous. In all probability the
<span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> mainmast would be carried away, but
in any case the mainsail would mask the spinnaker
and deprive it of its pulling power.</p>

<p>At the last bend, which was so gentle that
there was no necessity to gybe and reset the
spinnaker, the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> was fourth. A Poole boat,
staggering under a press of bellying sail, was
leading. Following her came the centre-keeled
Humber cutter, the crew of which had set a
large square sail in addition to their working
canvas. Next the Bristol boat, which, having
made good following her temporary grounding,
had failed to maintain her advantage while
running.</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of a mile ahead could be
seen the anchored boat that marked one end of
the finishing line. The distance was too short
to enable the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> to overhaul the remaining
three ahead. True, she drew level with the
Bristol cutter; but, impeded by the far-flung
bow wave of the latter, she was unable to continue
her advantage. Yet the pace was terrific.
Peter found himself wondering what would happen
when the competing yacht crossed the line. There
seemed no room to turn owing to the crowd of
anchored yachts and boats beyond.</p>

<p>“Stand by!” cautioned Mr. Grant crisply.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Bang!</span> went the gun for the foremost yacht.
Five seconds later another report greeted the
arrival of the second. Then, almost simultaneously,
the gun fired twice.</p>

<p>“Down spinnaker!”</p>

<p>No need for cautious movements now. Down
came the clouds of light canvas. The spinnaker
boom was topped up in double quick time.
Over went the helm. Brandon and Craddock
hauled away on the mainsheet. Heeling, the
<span class='it'>Kestrel</span> turned into the wind, shot clear of the
course, and dropped anchor almost in her former
berth.</p>

<p>“It’s been a thundering good race,” declared
Mr. Grant, moistening his parched lips; for now
that the ordeal was over his tongue felt unpleasantly
dry. “Signal to Talbot and the others
and tell them to come aboard. We’ll get tea.
Hello! There’s the <span class='it'>Merlin</span>. When did she arrive,
I wonder?”</p>

<p>The Falmouth Sea Scouts had brought up about
a hundred yards from the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span>, and several
other craft lay at anchor between them. Without
a dinghy, Mr. Grant could not pay her
a visit, although all on board the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> were
naturally curious to know what had happened
to her.</p>

<p>Presently Symington, Talbot and Wilson, and
Eric Little, together with the pup, came alongside.</p>

<p>“I say, sir!” exclaimed Talbot eagerly. “Can
we enter for the ex-service boats’ rowing match?
We’ve been talking to some Portsmouth Sea
Scouts. They say they’ll lend us a gig, if we like
to have a shot.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Mr. Grant, although he
knew that his lads, unaccustomed to pulling a
heavy four-oared boat and a strange one at that,
stood a poor chance of securing a win. “Row
ashore and accept the offer, and then hurry back
for tea. What time does the race start? Six?
Good!”</p>

<p>Talbot had been gone only a few minutes when
Craddock reported that the flagship was making
a general signal.</p>

<p>“They’re about to announce the result of the
race,” he added. “I’ve hoisted our answering
pennant, sir.”</p>

<p>Already a number of red and white pennants
hoisted “at the dip”—that is, half-way up—indicated
that the various craft concerned were
ready to receive the impending signal.</p>

<p>“Code flag over M, sir,” reported Craddock.
“They going to give the winning numbers.”</p>

<p>The first number—represented by the code
letter G—indicated that No. 7 was the winner of
the cup. That showed that the coveted trophy
had been carried off by the Poole Sea Scouts, who
had not only actually come in first, but were first
also on handicap.</p>

<p>When the second number went up, Craddock
gave a whoop of delight, while the rest of the
crew almost fell over themselves with excitement.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> had won the second prize, but only
by the narrow margin of five seconds.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew had only just finished their
much-appreciated tea when the <span class='it'>Merlin’s</span>
dinghy came alongside.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pendennis!” exclaimed Mr. Grant,
going on deck to receive his visitor. “What
happened to you?”</p>

<p>“A slice of bad luck,” replied the Cornishman.
“Our anchor tripped during the night when we
lay off Newtown. When we turned out we found
ourselves bumping on Warden Ledge. We must
have drifted nearly seven miles without knowing
it. Then, in trying to get off, we strained one of
our propeller blades and had to put into Yarmouth
to get it straightened. After that we came
on here.”</p>

<p>“And when did you arrive?”</p>

<p>“Early this morning,” replied Mr. Pendennis.
“In fact, so early that you lazy fellows were fast
asleep. We felt tempted to give you a hail.
Heartiest congratulations, Grant, in getting second
in that race.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Sorry you didn’t compete.”</p>

<p>The Cornishman smiled.</p>

<p>“My lads were a bit fagged out,” he replied.
“We’ve stood some long tricks this trip. ’Sides,
they’re keen on the ex-Service boats’ pulling
race and are conserving their strength for that
event.”</p>

<p>“We’re entering, too, sir,” announced Talbot.</p>

<p>“The more the merrier,” rejoined Mr. Pendennis.</p>

<p>While the two Scoutmasters were chatting upon
various subjects relating to the Jamboree the rest
of the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew went ashore to complete their
preparations.</p>

<p>The Portsmouth Sea Scouts were as good as
their word, for quite a serviceable gig was hauled
up on the hard for the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> lads’ use. More
than a dozen other ex-Service boats were also out
of the water, their respective crews busily engaged
in making ready for the fray or, rather, contest.</p>

<p>“What’s that stuff you’re putting on?” enquired
Craddock of a lad who hailed from
Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Black lead, look you,” replied the young
Welshman. “Want some? We have plenty,
look you.”</p>

<p>Seeing that several of the competing boats were
being treated in a similar fashion, Peter accepted
the generous offer and soon the bottom of the
borrowed gig was shining in a coat of black lead
thinned down with stale beer—a preparation
which, although filthy to handle, is in high favour
amongst rowers of racing craft.</p>

<p>As soon as the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew had applied the
“dope,” the gig was uprighted and a thorough
examination made of her oars and stretchers.
Craddock, as coxswain of the boat, meant to leave
little to chance, although he was quite aware of
the disadvantage of racing in a strange craft without
even the opportunity of having a preliminary
practice. But, he reflected sagely, there were
other crews similarly handicapped.</p>

<p>Just before six o’clock fourteen boats faced the
starter. By this time the ebb-tide was running
strongly against a steady sou’westerly breeze, with
the result that farther down the main channel
there was quite a sea running.</p>

<p>“Back there, No. 5!” shouted the somewhat
harassed starter through a megaphone.</p>

<p>No. 5’s crew dropped their oars and obediently
“toed the line.” They were hefty, bronzed-featured
lads from Margate. It was their first
race, and in consequence they were a bit excited.</p>

<p>“Tough lot, aren’t they?” remarked Heavitree,
stroke of the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> gig, as he moistened
the loom of his oar with salt water.</p>

<p>“Eyes on the boat,” cautioned Peter. “Stand
by!”</p>

<p>The starting gun crashed. Fifty-six backs bent
to the first stroke; fifty-six oars dipped almost as
one, and the fourteen competing boats leapt forward,
the coxswains shouting encouragement to
their men.</p>

<p>For the first hundred yards the line retained
its comparative straightness, but already some of
the rowers were splashing unnecessarily, and they
lost their “first wind,” and hadn’t begun to find
their second.</p>

<p>Then five of the boats shot ahead, amongst
them the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> borrowed gig. Her crew were
working with a will and getting every ounce of
power out of their backs and legs. They had a
style about them, and Peter, as he watched their
long, steady, and regular strokes, felt proud of his
chums.</p>

<p>Glancing out of the corner of his eye, Craddock
noticed that the Nottingham Sea Scouts’ boat was
level on her starboard beam. Her crew, admirably
trained, were rowing with the regularity of
clockwork. Instinctively, Peter felt that here was
a rival to be treated with respect.</p>

<p>To port, No. 7—the Pembroke crowd—was
forging ahead. The crew were rowing a quicker
stroke, but would they last? On the extreme
left, No. 14, the Whitby boat, had already established
a useful lead. Although losing the advantage
of the ebb-tide she was in smoother water
close to the bank, but at the first bend that
advantage would be lost.</p>

<p>Yet, Peter knew, there was little to be judged
by position at this stage. It was the stayer, not
the spurter, who seemed most likely to lead the
procession over the finishing line.</p>

<p>He looked at his crew. They were bearing up
bravely. Talbot looked a little flustered, but was
still rowing strongly. None of them had reached
the gasping stage yet, although rivulets of perspiration
trickled unhindered down their faces.</p>

<p>At the first bend the competitors met the full
force of the wind ’gainst tide. The lean bows of
the boat threw apart showers of spray, as the
knife-like stem cleft the curling waves.</p>

<p>It was here that the Nottingham lads found
themselves handicapped. Used to pulling in a
river, they had never had the opportunity of
rowing in a fairly high seaway. Their style,
admirable in smooth water, was at a decided disadvantage
in this “popple.” More than once
“bow” missed his stroke, his blade encountering
nothing more resistant than air as the boat rose
on the crest of a short, steep wave.</p>

<p>“We’re overhauling her all right,” thought
Peter.</p>

<p>Five lengths ahead the Portsmouth Sea Scouts
were leading. Pulling splendidly, they were
steadily increasing their lead, when misfortune
descended upon them. “Stroke’s” oar broke
just above the blade. The lad, falling backwards,
temporarily put No. 3 out of action. By the
time the latter had recovered and resumed his
oar, the boat had dropped to the seventh place.
Nevertheless under extremely adverse conditions
the lads continued their gallant struggle, the
oarless “stroke” sitting up and moving with the
rest to preserve the rhythm of the swing.</p>

<p>The mark buoy at last!</p>

<p>“Back, port! Pull, starboard!” ordered Peter.
Round swung the gig, rolling as she swung broadside
to the weather-going tide.</p>

<p>“Together!”</p>

<p>Now came the strenuous part of the whole race—the
last lap. The <span class='it'>Kestrels</span> were visibly tiring.
Even Heavitree’s Adam’s apple was working convulsively,
while the veins in his bared arms stood
out like whipcord. Talbot, looking utterly blown,
was pulling almost mechanically, gasping through
his wide open mouth in his efforts to fill his painfully
stifled lungs.</p>

<p>There was but one boat ahead. That was the
Pembroke one. The Welshmen were in a far
worse plight than Craddock’s crew. They had
let themselves go at the start, and were reaping
the consequences; yet they, too, were “sticking
it” with the fervid tenacity of their race.</p>

<p>For the present Peter dare not call upon his
loyal crew for an extra spurt. They were gaining
all the time, yet without the final and spectacular
burst they would not be able to overlap their
rivals. And, of course, the Welshmen would
almost certainly respond.</p>

<p>Three hundred yards from home the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span>
gig’s bows were level with the Pembroke boat’s
stern. The coxswain of the latter could be heard
calling to his men for the final effort. It was now
Peter’s chance, provided his jaded crew could
respond to it.</p>

<p>“Whack her up, lads!” he shouted. “Last
lap!”</p>

<p>Both boats were now in calmer waters. Nobly
the <span class='it'>Kestrels</span> responded to their coxswain’s call.
Blinded with perspiration, with bursting lungs
and violently throbbing hearts, aching muscles
and blistered palms, they were unconscious of
everything but the desire to make that extra
spurt.</p>

<p>Now they were dead level with the Welshmen.</p>

<p>“Keep it up, lads!” yelled Peter.</p>

<p>That was as much as they could do. To increase
the number of strokes was out of the
question. They were perilously close to the
breaking-point. Could they stay the course?</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> gig drew ahead. The Pembroke
coxswain in a shrill falsetto called upon his men
for a final effort. They tried. There was a sharp
crack. One of their stretchers had broken.</p>

<p>“Hard lines on them,” thought Peter. “But
we were winning, anyway.”</p>

<p>Then for the first time on the homeward run
Craddock glanced over his shoulder. He had a
shock. The nearest of the remaining competitors
was quite five lengths astern. Nothing short of a
disaster to the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> gig would give any of the
boats astern a chance to overtake her now, for
the finishing line was less than eighty yards
ahead.</p>

<p>But—and that it was that gave Peter a most
disconcerting jar—close to the edge of the channel
and out of the full force of the adverse tide was
the Nottingham boat.</p>

<p>By dint of sheer doggedness she had fought her
way through the choppy sea. Then, edging over
towards the mud-flats, she found herself under
conditions very similar to that of her native Trent.
The Nottingham Sea Scouts, admirably trained
and in the pink of condition, were not slow to
take advantage of the change of fortune. They
were now almost level with Craddock’s crew,
although separated by about fifty yards of water.</p>

<p>“Pull, lads, pull!” shouted Peter. “For all
you’re worth!”</p>

<p>The spirit was willing, but exhausted flesh was
unable to respond to the dictates of the brain.
Gallantly the crew bent their aching backs, tugging
ferociously at the tough ash oars. Then
Talbot missed a stroke, the badly trimmed blade
slithering ineffectually on the surface.</p>

<p>Before the lad could recover his stroke the gun
went.</p>

<p>“Way ’nough!” gulped Peter, and the thoroughly
exhausted rowers collapsed, sobbing in
their efforts to recharge their bursting lungs.</p>

<p>Completely bewildered, Peter looked in the
direction of the Nottingham boat. She was over
the line, her crew paddling easily towards the
flagship. The <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> gig was also across the
line—but there had been only one gun. What
did it mean?</p>

<p>Everyone in the anchored yachts seemed to be
cheering. So were the crowd on the beach. Then
another competing boat crossed the line with her
crew on the verge of utter exhaustion. They
received a gun.</p>

<p>Still puzzled, Craddock was dimly aware of
the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> dinghy coming alongside and of
Mr. Grant leaning over the gunwale and patting
him on the back.</p>

<p>“Well rowed!” exclaimed the Scoutmaster.
“Well rowed! Dead heat with the <span class='it'>Avalon</span>.
Let’s have your painter; we’ll tow you to the
beach. Yes, by Jove! you’ve tied with that crack
Nottingham crew, and honestly I never expected
you to have a look-in. Well done!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XXIV &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Snatched from the Deep</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>or</span> three consecutive days the weather remained
bright and with very little wind.
It was ideal conditions for almost every event
except sailing. The Sea Scouts held greasy pole
competitions, swimming races, diving contests,
and a great water tournament.</p>

<p>The latter event was great fun and turned out
to be a huge success. There were forty competitors
a side, most of them in fancy dress. Each
member of the opposing teams was “mounted”
on a barrel to which was affixed a rough representation
of a horse’s head, the cask being ballasted
sufficiently to enable the rider to keep his balance
if he used the utmost caution. The offensive
weapons consisted of poles ten feet in length
terminating in a well-padded ball of rags or
oakum, and also of short sticks to which were
attached blown-up bladders.</p>

<p>Every evening almost every member of the
numerous crews went ashore for a camp-fire sing-song,
while at various times there were competitions
in making bends and splices and other
nautical accomplishments.</p>

<p>At the close of the fourth day’s sing-song and
after most of the audience had dispersed, Mr.
Grant sent Craddock to the wireless tent with a
message for the Scoutmaster in charge.</p>

<p>Arriving at the tent, which was merely for the
purpose of keeping the four-valve receiving set in
the dry—for when a broadcast concert was on,
the sides of the tent were rolled up and the loud
speaker brought into the open—Peter found that
the Scoutmaster he sought had gone across to the
electrician’s quarter in order to arrange about recharging
some batteries.</p>

<p>“He won’t be long,” added his informant, a
King’s Scout belonging to a Berwick Troop.
“Try one of these phones while you’re waiting
and see what you can pick up. It will only be
Morse on the lower wave-lengths, I fancy. Can
you read Morse?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” replied Peter.</p>

<p>“Guess you won’t make head or tail of this lot
unless you’ve been trained to it,” continued the
Berwick lad. “We had a skilled postal telegraphist
in last night, and he was whacked. But
you can try.”</p>

<p>Craddock put on the head-phones, listened for
about twenty seconds, and then turned to his
companion.</p>

<p>“There’s an S.O.S.,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” retorted the other incredulously.
“It will be Niton calling CQ. You’re not the
first to imagine an S.O.S.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Berwick Sea Scout took up
another pair of phones. He listened and his
smile of incredulity vanished. Snatching up a
pencil, he wrote rapidly.</p>

<p>Peter, too, tried to follow the bewildering
succession of perplexing sounds and could not
make head or tail of it. He had to wait until his
companion had taken down the message and a
reply to it.</p>

<p>The S.O.S. was to the effect that the <span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span>
was badly grounded in a thick fog, position
approximately six miles north-west of Selsea Bill,
and that she was rapidly breaking up in the heavy
ground swell.</p>

<p>The reply was: “Hayling Island and Bembridge
lifeboats proceeding to your assistance.
Have requested Government tugs to be sent from
Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span> then wirelessed: “Must take
to boats.” Followed by a warning from the shore
station: “Do not attempt to land in your
boats.”</p>

<p>Then came the distressed vessel’s final and uncompleted
appeal: “Send help quickly. We
are——”</p>

<p>Craddock did not wait for the Scoutmaster’s
return. In fact, he rather surprised the Berwick
lad by his abrupt and hasty departure. He took
to his heels and ran as fast as he could to Mr.
Grant and told him the news.</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span> is the tramp we were lying
close to at Dartmouth,” he added.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Grant. “And judging by
her reported position she’s aground not far from
the mouth of this harbour. I don’t suppose we’ll
be of much use, but we’ll see what’s to be done.
Get the patrol together, Brandon. See that we’ve
first aid outfits, and bring a coil of two-inch rope
along. Warn any Scoutmasters you pass on your
way to the store, but I think most of them will
have heard of it already.”</p>

<p>It was now nearly half-past ten. The heavy
sea fog had held all the evening and was now
spreading inland, promising to get thicker before
very long. Overhead the stars were rapidly disappearing
from view. The air was perfectly still,
yet even at that distance the muffled roar of the
surf on Chichester Bar and the adjoining Pole
Sand could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>In remarkably quick time the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew
assembled. Most of them had electric torches.
Heavitree had brought a lifebelt, while Brandon
had got hold of not only a long length of
two-inch rope, but also a useful coil of heaving
line.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we run the dinghy over on a trek-cart,
sir?” asked Talbot.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant shook his head.</p>

<p>“It would be useless,” he decided. “You’ve
seen the breakers on that flat, sandy shore. No
boat could possibly be launched in that turmoil.
All ready?”</p>

<p>The crew set out. They were not alone,
for already various Scoutmasters had called out
their Troops in order to patrol the beach in
case any of the <span class='it'>Lumberjack’s</span> people were cast
ashore.</p>

<p>By this time the fog over the land had thickened
considerably. It was hardly possible to see the
outlines of the hedges on either side of the
narrow lanes, and in the darkness the only way
to find the right road was for a Sea Scout to swarm
up the various sign-posts and flash his torch upon
the painted directions. Unfortunately all the
would-be rescuers took the same route, with the
result that when they arrived on the beach they
were all bunched together, instead of being spread
out over a wide front.</p>

<p>They could see-nothing; hear nothing but the
thunder of the breakers in the still air. Mr. Grant
realised the difficulty. Each Scoutmaster had
control over his own Troop, but there was no one
to exercise authority over the whole.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any District Commissioner here?”
he enquired of another Scoutmaster. “If so, he
ought to take charge. We’re doing little good
huddled together. Survivors might be thrown
ashore anywhere between the mouth of the
harbour and Selsea Bill.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” agreed the other Scoutmaster.
“Hello! Here’s a car. Perhaps——”</p>

<p>The rays of the headlights seemed to stop short
within a few yards of the car, which had stopped
almost at the extreme edge of the hard ground.
Another four or five feet and the wheels would
have sunk in the soft sand above high-water
mark.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant went to the side of the car. He saw
with feelings of satisfaction that one of the occupants
wore the distinctive rig of a District
Commissioner.</p>

<p>“Glad you’ve come, sir,” he began. “We
want someone to straighten things out.”</p>

<p>He explained. The Commissioner, a retired
Army officer, grasped the situation at once. His
powerful voice pierced the fog. In five minutes,
discipline had remedied the defect of individual
initiative, and from a fixed point patrols were extending
right and left with an interval of ten paces
between each Sea Scout. Even at that short distance
each watcher was invisible to his nearest
neighbour, but they were within easy hailing
distance, so that communication throughout the
whole line—there were about 250 Sea Scouts
spread over a front of nearly one and a half miles—could
be maintained without difficulty.</p>

<p>The crew of the <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> found themselves in
patrol formation stepping out briskly over the
board-hard sand just above low-water mark.
There were Troops ahead of them and behind
them. At every half-minute came crisp orders
from the Scoutmasters of the rearmost parties;
until, glancing over his shoulder, Mr. Grant discovered
that the patrol immediately behind the
<span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew had extended and halted.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the Aberstour Sea Scouts.
Talbot halted and faced seawards; the rest continued
their march, Symington halting at the
tenth pace and so on, until the Patrol Leader
found himself on the right of his section of the
line.</p>

<p>It was an awesome business standing still and
peering through the fog at the misty white surf
as it broke and receded almost within a couple
of yards of the watchers. All of them were already
drenched with the flying spray, and although the
salt water felt quite warm at first, a succession of
shower baths soon became not only monotonous
but extremely unpleasant. What was happening
out to sea they knew not. They could only conjure
up mental pictures of the struggle for life on
the part of the shipwrecked crew as their crazy,
ill-conditioned craft was being rapidly battered
into scrap-iron somewhere within a mile of one
section of that far-flung line of would-be lifesavers.</p>

<p>Presently Brandon hailed his chum.</p>

<p>“Have you got Molly?” he enquired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Peter, who was holding the pup
in his arms. “She’s with me, but she’s got the
wind up frightfully.”</p>

<p>“We ought to have left her on board,” continued
the Patrol Leader.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t time,” rejoined Craddock.</p>

<p>“ ’Sides, she’d be far more terrified if she’d been
left by herself.”</p>

<p>Another ten minutes passed. Then the Scoutmaster
of the Troop on the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> right came
up to Mr. Grant.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat come ashore,” he reported.
“She was full of water and capsized as she was
thrown on the beach. The Weymouth Troop
have found eight of the crew. Two of them are
dead. There are a lot more to be accounted for.
Pass the information along, please.”</p>

<p>Presently from the left came the order, “Increase
interval by four paces.”</p>

<p>This was to fill up the gap left by the Weymouth
Sea Scouts, who, being engaged in the task of
restoring to life the apparently drowned members
of the <span class='it'>Lumberjack’s</span> crew, had left their section of
the shore unwatched. Already they were carrying
some of the survivors away in hastily constructed
stretchers to the shelter of an isolated
farm-house.</p>

<p>“Well, that looks like business, lads,” commented
Mr. Grant, as he passed behind the line.
“There are others still to come ashore. Keep a
smart look-out.”</p>

<p>It was easier said than done, so thick was the
fog, although the stars were beginning to show
overhead through the low-lying bank of salt-laden
vapour.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Molly began to bark furiously and
struggled so fiercely that Peter placed him on the
sand. Instantly she darted towards the water’s
edge, and although she retreated when the next
breaker swept forward, she followed up the
receding wave and continued to bark.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Brandon and Craddock rushed
forward. They were within ten feet of each other
before they discovered each other’s presence.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the Patrol Leader.</p>

<p>“Molly’s spotted something,” replied Peter.
“Look! It’s a life-buoy.”</p>

<p>The next wave brought the buoy almost to
Craddock’s feet, although he had to go knee-deep
into the retiring “undertow” before he could
secure it.</p>

<p>The canvas of the life-buoy was ripped in
several places, and most of the rope that ought
to be attached to it was missing; but painted on
it in black letters was the name “<span class='sc'>S.S.</span> <span class='it'>Lumberjack</span>.”</p>

<p>Hurling the life-buoy out of the way of the
breaking waves, Brandon was about to resume his
post when Craddock shouted to him.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/240.jpg' alt='' id='img240' style='width:90%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p>“Where’s the line?” he asked. “There’s a
man out there. Look out for Molly.”</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Grant and Carline
appeared through the fog. Already Peter was
securing one end of the rope round his waist.</p>

<p>“Look after Molly,” he reiterated. “She’ll
be after me if you don’t.” And, handing the
coiled portion of the rope to Mr. Grant and
Brandon, Craddock rushed into the water.</p>

<p>For the first ten yards his progress was hastened
by the undertow. Masses of milk-white foam
mingled with moving sand were swirling round
his legs and urging him on. He could see that
the succeeding breaker would be upon him before
he could get into deeper water. If it caught him
squarely it would hurl him like a stone upon the
beach, and probably batter the breath from his
body.</p>

<p>The crest towered high above his head. It
was almost upon him. But Peter kept a cool
head. As the wave broke, he dived into it, felt
himself being borne backwards, was conscious
of his feet coming in contact with the ground.
He wanted to kick, to leap until his head appeared
above the surging torrent. He felt he could keep
his breath no longer.</p>

<p>At last he broke surface and found himself
beyond the breaker. He struck out vigorously.
Found himself impeded.</p>

<p>“Pay out more line, you fellows!” he shouted.</p>

<p>He might well have saved his breath, for his
voice was inaudible in the roar of the surf. It
wasn’t that Brandon had neglected to give more
scope to the line; it was the drag of the water
against it.</p>

<p>There was no sign of the man he was risking
his life to save. Another wave came up, foaming
ready to break. Peter surmounted it just before
the angry crest toppled over. As he did so something
was thrown against his side—something
that felt like a sack of saturated sawdust.</p>

<p>Instantly Peter gripped the object. It was the
senseless body of a man.</p>

<p>Now came the supreme effort—to regain the
beach without being pounded by the breakers.
It was easy enough to come ashore—the waves
would see to that—but it was far from a simple
task to protect himself and his senseless burden
from the terrible onslaught of the hammering
surf. And such a lot depended upon the life-line
being hauled in at exactly the right moment.</p>

<p>The life-line, hitherto a hindrance, was now
apparently uselessly slack. Vaguely, Peter found
himself wondering what possessed the fellows on
the beach: why on earth weren’t they hauling
away for all they were worth?</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that even at that short
distance the shore was hidden in the fog. A mild
panic seized him. What if the rope had parted
and he was being carried out to sea?</p>

<p>Not for one moment did he relax his grip upon
his unconscious, perhaps lifeless, burden. Another
roller was on the point of breaking. Would it
batter him into a state of insensibility?</p>

<p>It overtook him, fortunately without toppling
over. Right on the crest he found himself, being
urged towards the shore at a tremendous pace.
Then with a loud roar the unstable mass broke.
Peter felt his feet touch the yielding sand. He
was surrounded by a swirling torrent of foam and
hurled sideways like a sack of flour.</p>

<p>Then he was conscious of the life-line tautening.
He was being swept back by the undertow.
In desperation he threw arms and legs round the
form of the helpless seaman in an endeavour to
prevent him being torn from his grasp.</p>

<p>The rope held. Half a dozen lusty men and
youths were tailing on to it. The pressure was
terrific. The sand, washed down by the undertow,
rasped Craddock’s face, hands, and knees.
His lungs seemed on the point of bursting.</p>

<p>Another wave was rearing its formidable crest.
Peter eyed it with apprehension. Magnified in
the fog, it looked higher than it actually was, but
the power behind it was none the less. He
wondered whether he could survive the threatened
hammering of the tremendous thunderous mass.</p>

<p>He was dimly conscious of vague forms surrounding
him, grasping arms and legs. Still he
held on to his helpless burden, and, since they
could not be separated, the pair were literally
dragged beyond the reach of the breaker.</p>

<p>It fell harmlessly, and, like a monster baulked
of its prey, retired growling and muttering to
merge into the turmoil of tumbling breakers.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;CHAPTER XXV &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Home Again</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen Peter</span> came to himself he was lying
on the wet sand with his head pillowed
on a greatcoat. Something warm was licking his
face. It was Molly. Overjoyed at her master’s
return, she could not be restrained from showing
her joy and relief in true doggie fashion, and her
delight redoubled when the Sea Scout opened his
eyes and attempted to sit up.</p>

<p>“Good old Peter!” exclaimed Brandon.
“How do you feel?”</p>

<p>“As if I’d been sand-papered,” replied Craddock,
with perfect truthfulness. Then, recalling
the reason for his present plight, he asked,
“Where’s the fellow we rescued? Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“He’s alive,” declared the Patrol Leader, and,
turning to Mr. Grant, he asked in a low voice,
“Can I tell him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” answered the Scoutmaster.</p>

<p>“Do you know who the fellow is?” continued
Brandon. “It’s Carlo Bone—Blueskin.”</p>

<p>Peter sat up.</p>

<p>“Really?” he rejoined. “Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In a farm-house with the others,” replied the
Patrol Leader. “All the crew of the vessel have
been accounted for. The patrols are being withdrawn.
I say, old man, can you walk or have we
to carry you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk,” declared Craddock stoutly.</p>

<p>They assisted him to his feet. He felt rather
groggy, for he had swallowed a fair quantity of
salt water and had been considerably bruised in
his struggle with the waves. Walking required
a great effort, and he was glad to take his chum
Brandon’s arm.</p>

<p>“I reckon this night’s work means a Silver
Cross for you, my lad,” declared Heavitree.</p>

<p>“Think so?” rejoined Peter. “I say; now
I tumble to it. That bucket lashed to our rudder.
Blueskin must have done that. Won’t he look
bluer than he is when he finds out we know.”</p>

<p>And Craddock went off into fits of hysterical
laughter and sat down inertly in a muddy lane.</p>

<p>The Sea Scouts carried him after that.</p>

<p>They did not take him on board that night.
Instead, he was put to bed in the shore hospital
tent, where Mr. Grant remained watching by
his side.</p>

<p>Next morning Peter awoke feeling quite his
normal self except for the fact that his limbs were
a bit stiff.</p>

<p>That afternoon Peter, accompanied by Mr.
Grant, Brandon, and Heavitree, went over to see
the man he had rescued. The visit was paid at
Blueskin’s request, for the man was really grateful.
Nevertheless the expression on his face was one
of comical dismay when he recognised the
members of the <span class='it'>Kestrel’s</span> crew.</p>

<p>“I’m right down sorry I played the dirty on
yer,” he declared.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Mr. Grant. “We’ll
call the account square. But why did you?”</p>

<p>“It’s like this ’ere,” explained Blueskin. “I
war fair upset when I found you’d bought that
there boat. I wanted ’er, and seein’ as I didn’t
get ’er, I sort o’ made up my mind no one else
shouldn’t. I oughtn’t tu ’ave tried to set she
afire, but I reckoned as you’d get out afore any
’arm was done yer.”</p>

<p>“Neither was there, fortunately,” added the
Scoutmaster. “But we didn’t know you were
the fellow. We thought you might be, so we
kept watch on your house all night.”</p>

<p>“I knows you did,” agreed Blueskin. “You
were outside my house when I got ’ome.”</p>

<p>“And how did you manage that?” asked Peter.</p>

<p>Blueskin gave the suspicion of a wink.</p>

<p>“That’s tellin’,” he answered oracularly. “But
I’m a-goin’ straight arter this, I am,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Craddock. “We hope
you will. But I think you can answer my question:
isn’t there an underground passage between old
Dick Marner’s shed and your cottage?”</p>

<p>For a moment Blueskin looked thunderstruck.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted. “Sure there is. ’Ow
did you twig it? Sakes alive! A chap like me
must get up very early in t’mornin’ tu get to
wind’ard of a Sea Scout, I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“How did you find out about the secret
tunnel?” asked Brandon of his chum after the
interview with Carlo Bone.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” replied Peter. “It was a guess on
my part. I’d been thinking things over, and, like
Mr. Grant got it out of young Marner that he
hadn’t a motor bike, that rather confirmed my
theory, although, of course, I might have been
wide of the mark.”</p>

<p>Little more remains to be told.</p>

<p>The Jamboree ran its course in perfect weather
and with unabated enthusiasm. At its termination,
Eric Little was sent to his uncle’s house at
Chichester, where life for him was considerably
brightened by his being able to have friends of
his own age. He lost no time in becoming a Cub.</p>

<p>After the termination of the Sea Scouts’ marine
festival, the assembly of yachts and boats dispersed.
The <span class='it'>Kestrel</span> got away in company with
nearly a dozen craft bound for the eastern part
of the English Channel and the East Coast.
Three days later she entered Aberstour Harbour
and made fast alongside the quay in the berth
the old <span class='it'>Puffin</span> had so long occupied.</p>

<p>“We’ve had a topping time,” declared Heavitree,
as the crew prepared to disperse to their
respective homes. “Course we’ve had sticky
times, too; but what’s the use of being Sea
Scouts if we don’t know how to tackle them?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t done so badly,” admitted Craddock
cautiously. “We’re here, safe and sound,
that’s the main point. And I don’t think it’s
entirely owing to good luck. I rather fancy
there’s another reason, and a jolly good one.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” enquired his chum.</p>

<p>“We’ve kept to the good old Scout’s motto:
‘<span class='sc'>Be Prepared.</span>’ ”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
